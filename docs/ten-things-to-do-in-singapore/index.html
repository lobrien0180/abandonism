Singaporeans almost treat shopping as a sport and therefore it is no surprise that there is no shortage of great places to shop. </p><p><a href="https://www.visitsingapore.com/en_au/see-do-singapore/places-to-see/orchard/?ref=localhost">Orchard Road</a> is perhaps Singapore’s most famous shopping destination and this street alone provides many hours of opportunities to spend money, the street lined with malls featuring designer brands and department stores, as well as a variety of bars and restaurants. <a href="https://www.vivocity.com.sg/?ref=localhost">VivoCity</a> is Singapore’s largest shopping mall, again filled with a variety of shops as well as outlets and entertainment. Another favourite is <a href="https://www.marinabaysands.com/shopping.html?ref=localhost">The Shoppes at Mariana Bay Sands</a>, the architecture adding to the impressiveness of the high end names and designer brands. Singapore has also cemented its name as a shopping destination by adding <a href="https://www.changiairport.com/en/discover/jewel.html?ref=localhost">The Jewel</a> (pictured below) to it’s Changi Airport. </p><p>If malls are not your thing, do not despair. Singapore offers plenty of outdoor and unique shopping opportunities via its outdoor markets (e.g. Bugis Street Market, Chinatown), busy roads (Serangoon Road, Little India) and little laneways such as Haji Lane (more on these <a href="https://www.abandonism.com/blog/ten-things-to-do-singapore?ref=localhost#neighbourhood">further below</a>).       </p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191111_183446.jpg" width="1500" height="1125" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20191111_183446.jpg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_20191111_183446.jpg 1000w, ../content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191111_183446.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191111_183518-01.jpg" width="1500" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20191111_183518-01.jpg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_20191111_183518-01.jpg 1000w, ../content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191111_183518-01.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="marina-bay">MARINA BAY</h2><p><a href="https://www.visitsingapore.com/en_au/see-do-singapore/places-to-see/marina-bay-area/?ref=localhost">Marina Bay</a> is an upscale area of skyscrapers, posh hotels and luxury malls all on a waterfront promenade featuring the iconic Marina Bay Sands; three towers topped off with an infinity pool that has become a well known feature of Singapore’s skyline.</p><p>Marina Bay has plenty to see and do, offering a bit of everything from shopping and food, to gardens and cruises.</p><p>But we can’t talk about Marina Bay without including more on <a href="https://www.marinabaysands.com/?ref=localhost">Marina Bay Sands</a> itself. Firstly, this hotel gets super busy and it is not cheap. The infinity pool located 57 stories up is only available to hotel guests, so if you’re like us and can’t fork out the cash for your entire Singapore stay at the Marina Bay Sands, book in a single night only and get your Instagram pics in the famous pool.

Each time we visit Singapore we try to visit at least one or two that we haven’t been to before, or sometimes just re-visit an old favourite.</p><p>Below are some of our favourite and most recommended neighbourhoods, as well as others to check out.</p><p><strong>Favourites:</strong></p><p><strong>Little India</strong> - Colourful and vibrant. The little lanes make walking easy while exploring the fascinating street art and historic temples, taking in the smells of spices and food.  </p><p><strong>Chinatown</strong> - The streets of Chinatown are a blend of old and new. The evidence of old Chinatown are evident via the buildings and temples and there is a Chinatown Heritage Centre to learn more about the early Chinese migrants to Singapore. Chinatown is perhaps the best area to steal a bargain if you’re a shopper but the attraction for us is definitely the food. A mix of cool restaurants and market/ hawker centre stalls mean there are food options at all price points and to suit everyone’s taste.</p><p><strong>Kampong Gelam</strong> - Quirky, colourful and interesting, this neighbourhood is my personal favourite. The area, sometimes referred to as the Arab Quarter, is located around the Sultan Mosque and there is no shortage of cool bars and eateries, funky boutiques and unique stores and it’s difficult to not fall in love with the vibrant laneways such as Haji Lane. </p><p><strong>Others to check out:</strong> <strong>Colonial/ Civic District </strong>for the historic buildings, memorials and museums; <strong>Joo Chiat</strong> for the vibrant shophouses and Peranakan culture; and <strong>Tiong Bahru</strong> for its architecture, history and hip shops.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/06/IMG_1562.jpg" width="999" height="999" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1562.jpg 600w, ../content/images/2025/06/IMG_1562.jpg 999w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/06/IMG_1571.jpg" width="999" height="999" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1571.jpg 600w, ../content/images/2025/06/IMG_1571.jpg 999w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191110_125553.jpg" width="1125" height="1125" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20191110_125553.jpg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_20191110_125553.jpg 1000w, ../content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191110_125553.jpg 1125w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/06/IMG_1520-1.jpg" width="999" height="999" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1520-1.jpg 600w, ../content/images/2025/06/IMG_1520-1.jpg 999w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/06/IMG_1526-1.jpg" width="999" height="999" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1526-1.jpg 600w, ../content/images/2025/06/IMG_1526-1.jpg 999w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/06/IMG_1601.jpg" width="999" height="999" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1601.jpg 600w, ../content/images/2025/06/IMG_1601.jpg 999w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="indulge-in-singapore%E2%80%99s-food-culture">INDULGE IN SINGAPORE’S FOOD CULTURE</h2><p>Singapore has an amazing food culture.

That all said, drinking in Singapore doesn’t come cheap which is why if you are ready for a good night out, choose well.</p><p>Our two repeat bars are 28 HongKong Street and The Other Room.</p><p><a href="https://28hks.com/?ref=localhost">28 Hong Kong Street</a> is one of Singapore’s first speakeasy bars and can be tricky to find behind the unmarked shopfront door on Hong Kong Street. But go inside and you’ll find cool tunes and shelves lined with top shelf drinks ready to mix up creative cocktails. </p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheOtherRoomSG">The Other Room</a> is another bar hidden away behind an unmarked door, this time inside the Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel. Press the buzzer and you’ll be welcomed into an intimate bar with an almost overwhelming choice of cocktails and quality liquors.</p><p>Not a bar, but also one we have given repeat business is <a href="https://www.boomarang.com.sg/?ref=localhost">Boomarang</a> in Robertson Quay. We like this place not because it’s an Australian bar but because it is a bit more casual and has a lovely location on the river, great for a quiet afternoon drink. I’ll also admit we came across Boomarang when I was looking for somewhere to watch an AFL game that I really didn’t want to miss. Boomarang is also good for live sport.</p><p>Just for a completeness we’ve added a few bars that are currently on our wish list and as we do finally get to them, will update this page.

But we’ve included it because it is a nice place to walk along during the day (and you can also include Boat Quay for that as well), and it’s a great place for a drink in the evening.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2025/06/IMG_20170826_221433.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20170826_221433.jpg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_20170826_221433.jpg 1000w, ../content/images/2025/06/IMG_20170826_221433.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>We usually stay around the Clarke Quay area because it feels so central to other places we will visit while in Singapore. Chinatown is within walking distance, Roberston Quay is close for more food and drink options, Marina Bay is not too far and there’s also great transport options with the MRT. But Clarke Quay is nice within its own right because you can stay local and still take in all of the energy of the party goers in the evening. You have lots of food and drinking options, you can take a boat ride on the river (admittedly we’ve never actually done this), it’s great for a morning run and there’s some good shopping options there as well. #winning</p><h2 id="take-in-the-arts-culture">TAKE IN THE ARTS &amp; CULTURE</h2><p>Something that is less spoken about (well at least from a tourist’s perspective) is Singapore’s arts and culture scene, which makes sense when you think about Singapore as a mix of cultures and histories.</p><p>Singapore has a wide choice of galleries, museums and temples and we have barely made a dent in all that it has to offer.</p><p>Some of the temples we think are worth checking out include : Thian Hock Keng Temple (Chinatown), Sri Mariamman Temple (Chinatown), Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple (Little India/ Rochor) and Buddha Tooth Relic Temple &amp; Museum (Chinatown).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../content/images/2025/06/IMG_1500.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1500.jpg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_1500.jpg 1000w, ../content/images/2025/06/IMG_1500.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple (Little India/ Rochor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For art try the <a href="https://www.operagallery.com/?ref=localhost">Opera Gallery</a>, <a href="https://www.gillmanbarracks.com/?ref=localhost">Gillman Barraks</a> (made up of 10 galleries) and <a href="https://deck.sg/?ref=localhost">Deck</a> for photographic art.</p><p>Oh, and don’t forget about the urban street art in some of <a href="https://www.abandonism.com/blog/ten-things-to-do-singapore?ref=localhost#neighbourhood">Singapore’s Neighbourhoods</a>. Haji Lane and Little India are particularly awesome for their street art.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/06/IMG_1521.jpg" width="917" height="917" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1521.jpg 600w, ../content/images/2025/06/IMG_1521.jpg 917w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/06/IMG_1579.jpg" width="1500" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1579.jpg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_1579.jpg 1000w, ../content/images/2025/06/IMG_1579.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/06/IMG_20170826_171620.jpg" width="1500" height="1125" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20170826_171620.jpg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_20170826_171620.jpg 1000w, ../content/images/2025/06/IMG_20170826_171620.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><p>For museums try the <a href="https://www.nhb.gov.sg/acm/?ref=localhost">Asian Civilisations Museum</a> which provides insight into the various Asian cultures that make up the base for Sinagpore’s multi-ethnic society (this is on our list for our next visit but believe you can easily spend a half day there). There are three main heritage centres that will give you the history and insight into the country’s main cultures - the <a href="https://www.indianheritage.org.sg/en?ref=localhost">Indian Heritage Centre</a>, <a href="https://www.malayheritage.org.sg/en?ref=localhost">Malay Heritage Centre</a> and <a href="https://chc.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/Home.aspx?ref=localhost">Chinese Heritage Centre</a>. Finally there is the <a href="https://www.nhb.gov.sg/nationalmuseum/?ref=localhost">National Museum of Singapore</a> which was established in 1887 and is Singapore’s oldest museum.</p><p></p><p>As you can see, there is a lot to see and do in Singapore and every visit we make we find more. Hopefully this post is helpful when planning your next trip or stopover to Singapore and we will try to add to the list as we discover more. Happy travels!</p>
