They also helped with organising transport which was a motor taxi with the loveliest driver.</p><p>I think we may have paid a little over the going rate at the equivalent of 30AUD per day - in general expect to pay 20-25AUD. For us the cost was worth it to have someone who was tied to the hotel, super reliable and a little bit flexible.</p><h2 id="where-we-ate-and-drank">WHERE WE ATE AND DRANK</h2><p>There is no shortage of places to eat or drink in Siem Reap. Actually the most difficult part is getting to as many as possible, there are so many fun and tasty options.</p><p>As noted above, we did have a cafe in our hotel however we found coffee more suited our tastes at <a href="https://m.facebook.com/Fifty5-Kitchen-Bar-1653272741664957/?locale2=ja_JP&ref=localhost">Fifty 5 Kitchen Bar</a> (illy coffee) and <a href="http://www.sistersreycafe.com/?ref=localhost">Sister Srey Cafe</a>.

Passes are also specific to you and a photo is taken on the spot to attach at the time of purchase. We did a 3 day pass which worked well for the time we were there and gave us more than enough time to see what we wanted to see.

Then there is the Grand Circuit which covers some of the further away temples. If you are there for only a day then the Small Circuit is definitely your best option. Start with the main two sites and choose from the rest based on time. If you have 2-3 days then you will have more than enough time to cover the Grand Circuit and maybe a coupe of others outside of it, like we did.</p><p>Going in our plan was to complete the Small Circuit on day one, sunrise at Angkor Wat Temple followed by the remaining temples in the Grand Circuit day two and a couple on the way to visit a floating village on day three. Mostly we stuck to this plan except that on day one we ran out of time for some of the temples on the Small Circuit so had to push them to day two, and our sunrise at Angkor Wat was a bit of a disaster.</p><p>#sunrisefail</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/06/IMG_1210.jpg" width="1500" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1210.jpg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_1210.jpg 1000w, ../content/images/2025/06/IMG_1210.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/06/IMG_1219.jpg" width="1500" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1219.jpg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_1219.jpg 1000w, ../content/images/2025/06/IMG_1219.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><p>The sunrise at Angkor Wat on day two was a non-event with foggy conditions and obviously, no sun.

We had a couple of days we could have added but felt we actually probably wanted more like 3-4 days.</li><li>Battambang - Cambodia’s second largest city and from our research has plenty to see and do if you have a couple of extra days. The local culture, countryside, temples and French architecture are all noteworthy.</li><li>A Cambodian food cooking class (next time for sure!).<br></li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2025/06/IMG_1073-2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1073-2.jpg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_1073-2.jpg 1000w, ../content/images/2025/06/IMG_1073-2.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>
