But if we were to talk true bucket list destinations then Egypt has to have been at the top of that list.</p><p>About 3-4 years ago we looked at Egypt and seriously considered going, however there was still political instability in the country and the odd terrorist attack and so we shelved it for a while longer. But mid-last year when we were planning future coming trips, Egypt finally felt like a &#x2018;go&#x2019; and so we booked it in.</p><p>Then to the itinerary. Because there are so many historic sites in Egypt and they are quite spread out we struggled to come up with a plan and certainly one that was easy to execute. We are not tour group people and we spent months fighting what appeared to be the easiest way to do it. We tried re-creating tour itineraries and honestly, I think it can be done if you have a bit of time to spend on the planning and booking processes, but time is something we&#x2019;re generally quite poor in and so after months of indecision we capitulated and booked ourselves on a tour.</p><p>The company we chose was <a href="https://www.gadventures.com.au/?ref=localhost">G Adventures</a> as they have a number of tours in Egypt. We were looking for something that was just short of 2 weeks and covered as much ground as possible, leading us to choose the<a href="https://www.gadventures.com.au/trips/egypt-upgraded/7386/?ref=localhost"> Egypt Upgraded</a> tour. The tour went for 12 days, although the first and last days were really nothing days that you could use how you chose. We also added a day to see some more of Cairo, not something we&#x2019;d generally recommend, but more about that <a href="https://www.abandonism.com/blog/egypt?ref=localhost#itinerary">below</a>. The other thing we liked about G Adventures was that the guide is a qualified Egyptologist, something that is difficult to access when organising the trip on your own. </p><p>For this post I haven&#x2019;t broken it down on a day by basis but rather location. However if you are interested in the itinerary we followed, or the hotels we stayed in, please refer to the <a href="https://www.gadventures.com.au/trips/egypt-upgraded/7386/itinerary/?ref=localhost">Egypt Upgraded itinerary</a> for further details. </p><p>We&#x2019;ve also provided some final <a href="https://www.abandonism.com/blog/egypt?ref=localhost#itinerary">thoughts and potential tweaks</a> you could make towards the end of this post should you want to use the itinerary as a base for your own trip. But for now, let us show you Egypt!</p><h2 id="cairo">CAIRO</h2><p>Our time and tour in Egypt started and ended in Cairo and we had added a day at both ends. </p><p>Cairo is massive and has a population of around 20 million people when you include the &#x2018;greater Cairo&#x2019; area. Like any city of this size it suffers from traffic gridlock and high levels of pollution. Also evident when getting around Cairo are the low income levels. But the people are generally nice and very willing to help tourists.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_2818.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Egypt" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_2818.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/IMG_2818.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_2818.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>As we knew that the Pyramids and Museum would be covered on our tour we decided to check out other parts of the city. Our hotel (the one designated by G Adventures) was located in Giza. It turns out the hotel was great for seeing the pyramids but not seeing anything else as it is quite a way out of the city.</p><p>We spent a good part of one of our free days checking our Khan el Kalili and surrounds. Khan el-Khalili is an ancient bazaar adjacent to the Al-Hussein Mosque. </p><p>In the bazaar we wondered around checking out the many treasures for sale and drinking Egyptian coffee. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_2773-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Egypt" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_2773-1.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/IMG_2773-1.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_2773-1.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_20200218_125559-02.jpg" width="1500" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="Egypt" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_20200218_125559-02.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/IMG_20200218_125559-02.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_20200218_125559-02.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_2793.jpg" width="999" height="999" loading="lazy" alt="Egypt" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_2793.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_2793.jpg 999w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><p>On a different day we took an Uber to the Egyptian Museum and went for a walk around the local neighbourhood. We then walked across to Gezira Island via the Qasr al-Nil Bridge. As a side note we had planned to look around Tahrir Square, the centre of the Arab Spring protests, but were advised to come on a different day by a local man. We were there on a Friday (day of prayer) and he told us that Friday&#x2019;s can get a bit &#x2018;political&#x2019; and didn&#x2019;t want us to get caught up in anything. He said it was &#x2018;safe&#x2019; just better to come back on a different day.</p><p>Gezira Island felt like a more &#x2018;upmarket&#x2019; area with its sporting clubs and embassies. We did a lot of walking on the island, walking from one end to the other, via the Cairo Tower (we didn&#x2019;t go up the tower). At the other end and after many hours of walking we had a late lunch at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/leftbankonline">Left Bank</a>, a cozy cafe with delicious food and a beautiful view of the water.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_2182.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="Egypt" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_2182.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_2182.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_20200207_150008.jpg" width="1125" height="1125" loading="lazy" alt="Egypt" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_20200207_150008.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/IMG_20200207_150008.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_20200207_150008.jpg 1125w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_20200207_145817.jpg" width="1125" height="1125" loading="lazy" alt="Egypt" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_20200207_145817.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/IMG_20200207_145817.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_20200207_145817.jpg 1125w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><p>The rest of Cairo we saw on our tour.</p><p>Our tour started with the Pyramids of Giza. Given the close proximity to our hotel, we arrived there early and listened to the history of the pyramids from our guide and Egyptologist Sa&#x2019;id before having time to go for a wonder and take a ton of photos.  </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/_MG_5799.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Egypt" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/_MG_5799.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/_MG_5799.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/_MG_5799.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The pyramids are amazing and I had to keep pinching myself to believe we were actually there. That said, they were actually not the most amazing site we visited in Egypt and we were a little disappointed to see how close the city gets to the site with new buildings and housing estates starting to encroach on the sandy area.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_2214.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Egypt" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_2214.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/IMG_2214.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_2214.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>We also paid for entrance to the Great Pyramid to see what was inside (you could also pay for entrance to the second pyramid). Inside the Great Pyramid it was very crowded and if you are claustrophobic I&#x2019;d strongly advise against going in there as the descending passage is extremely narrow and dark. We did make it to the centre but truthfully I was really glad to get back out. Others in our tour did the second pyramid and if we were to do this again we would definitely go for the smaller pyramid where entrance was cheaper and there were less people. </p><p>Following our inspection of the pyramids we wondered down to see the Sphinx. Again the experience felt a little surreal after seeing this structure so many times in photos and documentaries but it is smaller than I&#x2019;d expected.</p><p>One tip and it is a kind of an obvious one - get to the Pyramids and Sphinx as early as you can. We actually made a return visit on our final day in Cairo as we wanted to try and get photos without all of the people, and we were mostly successful as most tourists and groups start at the Great Pyramid and spend quite a bit of time there before moving to the other monuments. We definitely felt it was worth the return visit.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/_MG_5740.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="Egypt" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/_MG_5740.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/_MG_5740.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_2823.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="Egypt" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_2823.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_2823.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><p> The <a href="https://egyptianmuseum.org/?ref=localhost">Egyptian Museum</a> in central Cairo was amazing for the amount of pieces it holds and based on what our guide Sa&#x2019;id explained, the public only ever see a fraction of everything that gets stored there. That said, while we were there a lot of work was under way to move major pieces to the new <a href="http://gem.gov.eg/?ref=localhost">Grand Egyptian Museum</a> located in Giza. This new museum was still under construction when we were there, but judging by its size, it looked like it would be easy to spend a whole day there.</p><p>For the existing museum, I would note that without our guide this museum would be very difficult to make sense of. There are so many pieces on display, most without any explanation. We spent a couple of hours with our group and Sa&#x2019;id before having another couple of hours on our own to explore, including a visit to the Mummy Rooms where for a small additional cost you can view the ancient remains of some of Egypt&#x2019;s most important rulers. Truthfully I found those rooms a little creepy but glad we checked them out all the same. </p><p>The (existing) museum should take a half day visit but do try and get a guide to take you through it before exploring yourself in order to get maximum value and appreciation of what you will see.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_20200210_142811.jpg" width="1125" height="1125" loading="lazy" alt="Egypt" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_20200210_142811.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/IMG_20200210_142811.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_20200210_142811.jpg 1125w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_20200210_141818.jpg" width="1125" height="1125" loading="lazy" alt="Egypt" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_20200210_141818.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/IMG_20200210_141818.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_20200210_141818.jpg 1125w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/download_20200603_104020.jpg" width="656" height="656" loading="lazy" alt="Egypt" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/download_20200603_104020.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/download_20200603_104020.jpg 656w"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/download_20200603_104017.jpg" width="1125" height="1125" loading="lazy" alt="Egypt" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/download_20200603_104017.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/download_20200603_104017.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/download_20200603_104017.jpg 1125w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="alexandria">ALEXANDRIA</h2><p>Not actually in Alexandria, but on our way from Cairo to Alexandria, we stopped by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastery_of_Saint_Pishoy?ref=localhost">St Bishoy Monastery</a> in Wadi El-Natrun. </p><p>This monastery is the most eastern surviving Christian monastery in the Wadi el-Natrun and the most famous of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria and was found by St. Bishoy (hence the name).</p><p>The monastery is amazing and dates back to the 4th century.

The catacombs seemed to merge Roman, Greek and Egyptian styles and apparently after not being used since the 4th century were rediscovered in in 1900 when a donkey accidentally fell into the access shaft. </p><p>Our visit to the catacombs was followed by a visit to the close by Pompey&apos;s Pillar, a Roman triumphal column and one of the best-known ancient monuments still standing in Alexandria today. We learned that the name &quot;Pompey&apos;s Pillar&quot; is actually a misnomer, as it has nothing to do with Pompey, having been erected in 293AD for Emperor Diocletian.</p><p>Next we took a look at the new Library of Alexandria, The Bibliotheca Alexandrina. The library was inaugurated in 2002 near the site of the old Royal Library of Alexandria, what had once been the largest library in the world. That said, the new library was pretty impressive in its own right.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_20200209_085402.jpg" width="1125" height="1125" loading="lazy" alt="Egypt" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_20200209_085402.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/IMG_20200209_085402.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_20200209_085402.jpg 1125w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_2275.jpg" width="999" height="999" loading="lazy" alt="Egypt" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_2275.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_2275.jpg 999w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_2312.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="Egypt" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_2312.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_2312.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_2296.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="Egypt" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_2296.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_2296.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_2295.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="Egypt" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_2295.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_2295.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_2287.jpg" width="999" height="999" loading="lazy" alt="Egypt" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_2287.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/IMG_2287.jpg 999w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><p>We also made a visit to the Citadel of Qaitbay, a 15th-century defensive fortress located on the sea coast.

We then spent about 30 mins or so listening to our guide who gave us the history, a huge positive about being on a tour. Then the negative to being on a tour, we wanted to take photos at the same time as everyone else and it was chaos in and outside the temples as we got in peoples photos and they got in ours. So here is a hint: have a look around the temples and take them both in and then sit outside in the sunshine and just wait. At about 10:30am everyone starts to slowly leave and you can get good photos minus the crowds. Our tour guide had agreed to hold back an extra 15 mins so we could do that and it&#x2019;s definitely the only way we could get the photos we did with the itinerary we were on. And as an added bonus we had time in between to really enjoy the temples. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/_MG_5775.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Egypt" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/_MG_5775.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/_MG_5775.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/_MG_5775.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="nile-cruise">NILE CRUISE</h2><p>Back in Aswan we boarded our accommodation for the next few nights, a river boat on the Nile. </p><p>There were at least a dozen boats lined up ready to take tourists.

While you definitely need to spend some time in Cairo, if for no other reason than to see the Giza Pyramids, it is just a big, chaotic city. It is difficult to get around, crowded and quite dirty. We were pretty annoyed we had actually added a day!</p><p>Also, our tour accommodation put us in Giza which wasn&#x2019;t great for getting around, so maybe look more central if staying there longer than just to see the pyramids. A further tip: use Uber to get around. It&#x2019;s extremely reliable, we felt safe (well as safe as you can in Cairo traffic) and there was no messing around with money, prices and haggling.</p><p>The next thought we had is in regards to visiting the city of Alexandria. </p><p>We liked Alexandria and there are some great things to see however we would recommend against going in the cooler months as it&#x2019;s actually quite hostile to walking around. As a coastal city it would definitely be much nicer in the warmer months. Uber also worked well in Alexandria.</p><p>Down south is where most of the cool stuff to see is.</p><p>To get to southern Egypt we went by plane, as opposed to bus or train, flying Nile Air one way and EgyptAir the other. Both airlines were good when we flew them, on time and fairly efficient. I know bus or train would be cheaper, but if you are strapped for time and also as a DIY option where you can book online, flying works well.</p><p>What I would do differently from our tour itinerary, is fly to Abu Simbel as opposed to Aswan, stay for a night in Abu Simbel so that you can see the temples early before the crowds, and then arrange a transfer to Aswan. I don&#x2019;t know about organising buses in one single direction although, in my experience, Egyptians always find a way to make things happen for a fee. Your other option is to fly from Abu Simbel to Aswan, a short (and from my understanding), fairly inexpensive flight. That way you can enjoy the town of Aswan for a night or two and continue to use it as the starting point for the Nile River Cruise. &#xA0;</p><p>Luxor was a great place to see a lot. We had two full days there which was probably spot on.</p><p>One thing we didn&#x2019;t do and regretted later was to visit Saqqara and Memphis. Saqqara is the site of Egypt&apos;s first pyramid and we had the option of doing it on the final day of our tour but opted against it in order to get some rest (I wasn&#x2019;t feeling well at this stage). However others in our group did do the day visit and it looked pretty awesome, so something worth looking into as a day trip.</p><p>If we had extra days another thing that would be great to build into an itinerary would be the southern coast of Egypt, known for snorkeling and diving opportunities, e.g. Wadi EL Gemal National Park, Hurghada, etc.</p><p>There are also places such as Sharm el-Sheikh, although Australian Government directives on where is safe to travel impact such itinerary decisions.</p><p><strong>Final word</strong></p><p>Obviously when you chose a group tour provider you are tied to a very specific itinerary and there&#x2019;s always going to be some hits and misses. We were lucky in that it was mostly hits but as you can see, there were definitely some things we would change if we were do this trip again/ourselves.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/download_20200603_104001.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Egypt" loading="lazy" width="1329" height="997" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/download_20200603_104001.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/download_20200603_104001.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/05/download_20200603_104001.jpg 1329w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Central Australia Road Trip (Pt.2): Alice Springs & the long trip home]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>As alluded to in <a href="https://www.abandonism.com/blog/central-australia-pt1?ref=localhost">part one of our Central Australia trip post</a>, the second half of our drive underwent a major change.

Our original itinerary had us heading to Alice Springs and then further north before turning back east on a scenic journey back to Sydney. However a combination of extreme heat, advice from locals in regards to the state of the Plenty Highway and the lack of vehicle preparedness (e.g. only a single spare tyre) added up to the very difficult decision to turn Fran around at Alice Springs and head back South.

He is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorny_devil?ref=localhost">Thorny Devil</a> and looks much scarier than he actually is.

We chose Clare because it was one wine region in South Australia we had yet to visit and had limited exposure to the bushfires.</p><p>On the way we made a couple of stops. The first in Port Pirie where Mike&#x2019;s ancestors had worked and lived, making it a good place to stop for a quick beer on yet another hot day.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/Port-Pirie---Mike.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Central Australia Road Trip (Pt.2): Alice Springs &amp; the long trip home" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/Port-Pirie---Mike.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/Port-Pirie---Mike.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2025/06/Port-Pirie---Mike.jpg 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w2400/2025/06/Port-Pirie---Mike.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The second stop was at Lake Bumbunga in the town Lochiel, in the Clare wine region.</p><p>Lake Bumbunga is famous for its bubblegum pink colour which it gets from a salt-loving algae that is attracted to the high salinity levels found in the water.

While the extreme heat was a factor, we would have managed that. it was really the advice from locals in regards to the state of the Plenty Highway that changed our minds. We had done research prior to our trip and learned that the road conditions do vary throughout the year,<strong> </strong>but nothing indicated to us just how bad it actually would be.<strong> </strong></p><p>We had planned on averaging somewhere between 60-80km/h on a corrugated but consistent surface meaning the 750km road could be done in a long day, but recent reports from locals indicated long sections with speeds down to 30km/h. Combined with a lack of vehicle preparedness (e.g. only a single spare tyre) and lack of experience with Fran&#x2019;s fuel consumption, we made the difficult decision to turn around at Alice Springs and head back South.<strong> </strong>Refer to the <a href="https://www.boulia.qld.gov.au/?ref=localhost">Boulia Shire Council</a> website for latest conditions if you are planning on travelling along the Plenty Highway.</p><p>We are still keen to get to places like Birdsville and Mudgee so we&#x2019;ll have to plan those into future trips (and Mike still has an appointment with Big Red). </p><p>If we were to re-do this trip we would re-jig our Uluru and Alice Springs time, removing a night from each, so that we could add Kings Canyon. Missing the Canyon was a bit of a disappointment but I guess that&#x2019;s just another reason to visit there again in the future.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/Itinerary.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Central Australia Road Trip (Pt.2): Alice Springs &amp; the long trip home" loading="lazy" width="747" height="240" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/Itinerary.jpeg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/Itinerary.jpeg 747w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Central Australia Road Trip (Pt.1): Broken Hill, Coober Pedy & Uluru]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Central Australia is a trip we had talked about forever and the purchase of Fran made us all the more eager to get out there and explore it. </p><p>Normally we spend our Christmas and New Year in Melbourne with family and friends however with forced leave from work we decided</p>]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/central-australia-road-trip-pt-1-broken-hill-coober-pedy-uluru/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">678c6ce92dafeb0001564b9f</guid><category><![CDATA[Australia]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Abandonism]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1971-1.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1971-1.jpg" alt="Central Australia Road Trip (Pt.1): Broken Hill, Coober Pedy &amp; Uluru"><p>Central Australia is a trip we had talked about forever and the purchase of Fran made us all the more eager to get out there and explore it. </p><p>Normally we spend our Christmas and New Year in Melbourne with family and friends however with forced leave from work we decided to use the holiday period a little differently this time around.

So as this post is titled, this is the first part and covers our drive from Sydney to Uluru and our stay in the towns along the way, including Uluru itself.</p><p>Below is a map of the route we took.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-24-at-12.52.32-pm.png" class="kg-image" alt="Central Australia Road Trip (Pt.1): Broken Hill, Coober Pedy &amp; Uluru" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1203" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-24-at-12.52.32-pm.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-24-at-12.52.32-pm.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-24-at-12.52.32-pm.png 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-24-at-12.52.32-pm.png 2330w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="trangie">Trangie</h3><p>Our departure from Sydney was a mixture of happiness, relief and sadness. In the days and weeks leading up to our trip Sydney had been covered in a heavy smoke haze from the most horrific bushfires that NSW (and Australia) had ever encountered. Even as we drove out of Sydney and through the Blue Mountains we were reminded of what was still taking place (and about to get much worse) as the road was clouded in smoke and visibility poor.</p><p>Originally when planning our trip we had been a tad ambitious with our first stop to be in Broken Hill. But as the day came closer and we gave this more thought a 13+ hour drive seemed a bit unrealistic so we built in an additional day and stop and made our first stop in a town called Trangie (approx. 460km). This was even more sensible give the heat we were driving through was in excess of 40C degree temperatures (~104 F).</p><p>We arrived in Trangie early evening, opting to stay in <a href="https://www.trangiecaravanpark.com.au/?ref=localhost">Trangie Caravan Park</a>. As noted in our introduction, we opted not to use Fran&#x2019;s tent accommodation due to the extreme temperatures we were staying in (around 40C at midnight). At the caravan park we checked-in to a very comfortable and air-conditioned cabin for 100AUD before heading out to the local RSL for a cheap and cheerful dinner. Truthfully it felt a tad strange to walk through town with its quiet streets after coming from Sydney. But Trangie was a good place for an overnight stop and 5:30am the following day we were back on the road in an effort to beat some of the worst of the daytime heat.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191221_065301.jpg" width="1500" height="1125" loading="lazy" alt="Central Australia Road Trip (Pt.1): Broken Hill, Coober Pedy &amp; Uluru" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20191221_065301.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_20191221_065301.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191221_065301.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191221_065235.jpg" width="1500" height="1125" loading="lazy" alt="Central Australia Road Trip (Pt.1): Broken Hill, Coober Pedy &amp; Uluru" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20191221_065235.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_20191221_065235.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191221_065235.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><p>We found driving through country NSW interesting. Besides the little country towns we made stops at along the way, e.g. Cobar, we also found the change in landscape and scenery fascinating. Starting our drive in Sydney on coastline,  moving through forest and farmland and eventually coming onto red soil and desert landscape. The contrast was amazing and happened much quicker than we had expected.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1614.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Central Australia Road Trip (Pt.1): Broken Hill, Coober Pedy &amp; Uluru" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1614.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_1614.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1614.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="broken-hill">Broken Hill</h3><p>Our next stop was in Broken Hill (approx. 680km) where we stayed for a couple of nights, timing that was actually pretty spot on in terms of things to do and see there. </p><p>The town itself felt quite deserted, I think given the heat and time of year (Christmas), many people had taken the opposite approach to us and headed towards the coast (see picture 1 below, photos L-R where 1 is top left and 6 bottom right).  </p><p>Highlights of Broken Hill for us included:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.thepalacehotelbrokenhill.com.au/?ref=localhost">The Palace Hotel</a> (famous from the film &#x2018;Priscilla - Queen of the Desert&#x2019;) where we stopped for a beer </li><li>The Broken Hill Miner&#x2019;s Memorial which also offered up some great views of the town (photo 4 and photos 2, 3 and 5)</li><li><a href="https://www.prohart.com.au/?ref=localhost">Pro Hart Gallery</a> where we learned a lot about an artist we only really knew from a carpet ad.

This drive was a little precarious at the start as we drove cautiously to avoid early morning Kangaroos and then took us across the NSW/SA border and through some of the most extreme heat throughout our trip. Also a word or warning for crossing the state border into SA: remember to eat any fruit or vegetables you have before the crossing as we lost all of our apples and bananas. </p><p>We made a couple of stops along the way but the harshest by far was where we stopped for lunch, Lake Hart Rest Area.

So of course we had to stay in one of Coober Pedy&#x2019;s underground hotels. We had booked <a href="https://theundergroundmotel.com.au/?ref=localhost">The Underground Motel</a>, located in a quiet spot on the edge of the town and were pleasantly surprised at just how cool the rooms stay. In spite of the extreme heat outside (44C/111F degrees in the shade) and no air-conditioning inside, the rooms were always a cool, pleasant temperature. The rooms were basic but the motel does offer a complimentary breakfast as well as facilities to cook your own meals, which we&#x2019;d actually highly recommend as the food options in town were not great.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191223_172800.jpg" width="769" height="769" loading="lazy" alt="Central Australia Road Trip (Pt.1): Broken Hill, Coober Pedy &amp; Uluru" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20191223_172800.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191223_172800.jpg 769w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191223_170717.jpg" width="1004" height="1004" loading="lazy" alt="Central Australia Road Trip (Pt.1): Broken Hill, Coober Pedy &amp; Uluru" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20191223_170717.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_20191223_170717.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191223_170717.jpg 1004w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><p>We only had a day in Coober Pedy and picked 3 things that we wanted to do.

The gallery has some cool local art for purchase and they do kangaroo feeding sessions at regular times throughout the day (check their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JOSEPHINES-GALLERY-KANGAROO-ORPHANAGE-129284050419402/">Facebook page</a> or contact for more information on this). The orphanage takes in rescued and injured wildlife in the Coober Pedy area (mostly baby kangaroos, but some other animals and older kangaroos as well). Even if you decide not to purchase any of the artwork you can also donate directly to the cause. The below joey had been found in the pouch of its dead mum on the side of the highway but was looking pretty healthy due to the care it was receiving.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1810.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="Central Australia Road Trip (Pt.1): Broken Hill, Coober Pedy &amp; Uluru" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1810.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1810.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1809.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="Central Australia Road Trip (Pt.1): Broken Hill, Coober Pedy &amp; Uluru" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1809.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1809.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><p>Our visit to Coober Pedy was probably not at the best time of the year. It was super hot preventing us from walking around for long and as the town was quiet coming into Christmas, a number of businesses were closed. As a result we missed out on seeing a couple of things, e.g. Opal fields, and in terms of food options the best ones we tried were John Pizza bar and the Outback bar &amp; Grill. We didn&#x2019;t rate the &#x2018;go to&#x2019; bar in the town at the Desert Cave Hotel, it was just weird, so we found it better to BYO.</p><p>We liked Coober Pedy but equally were keen to head further north after 2 nights in the town and super excited to make our way to Uluru.</p><h3 id="uluru">Uluru</h3><p>Christmas morning and another early start as we tried to take advantage of the slightly cooler air. Again we needed to be careful of kangaroos although there we saw fewer around Coober Pedy than we had in some other areas we had driven through.</p><p>Excellent roads and next to no traffic allowed us to do the 390km to the Northern Territory border by mid-morning, a triumphant moment. Australia really is a big country.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1860.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Central Australia Road Trip (Pt.1): Broken Hill, Coober Pedy &amp; Uluru" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1860.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_1860.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1860.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>From there we continued towards Uluru and our accommodation at Ayers Rock resort.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1892.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Central Australia Road Trip (Pt.1): Broken Hill, Coober Pedy &amp; Uluru" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1892.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_1892.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1892.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><a href="https://www.ayersrockresort.com.au/?ref=localhost">Ayers Rock Resort </a>is like a little oasis in the middle of the desert, except that it&#x2019;s actually quite a large complex and is hot and dry much like the environment it is located in.</p><p>The resort is made up of 8 accommodation options, catering for different price points and experiences. We had originally booked 3 nights in The Lost Camel Hotel (as a Christmas Present to ourselves) and the last 2 nights in the Ayers Rock Campground. However with minimum temperatures still in the high 30s at night we cancelled the camping and increased our hotel stay to 5 nights. Yes we are weak, but after all, it was Christmas!</p><p>The Lost Camel Hotel is one of the resort&#x2019;s mid-range budget options with a pool and located next to the Resort Town Square which was good for stocking up on snacks and some cheaper food options. The rooms were compact but comfortable and of course air-conditioned. We also had breakfast included in our first few nights, provided at the Ilkari Restaurant in the Sails Desert Hotel.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191227_092233.jpg" width="2000" height="2666" loading="lazy" alt="Central Australia Road Trip (Pt.1): Broken Hill, Coober Pedy &amp; Uluru" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20191227_092233.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_20191227_092233.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2025/06/IMG_20191227_092233.jpg 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w2400/2025/06/IMG_20191227_092233.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/Lost-Camel-Pool.jpg" width="480" height="480" loading="lazy" alt="Central Australia Road Trip (Pt.1): Broken Hill, Coober Pedy &amp; Uluru"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/Lost-Camel-Room.jpg" width="480" height="480" loading="lazy" alt="Central Australia Road Trip (Pt.1): Broken Hill, Coober Pedy &amp; Uluru"></div></div></div></figure><p>The resort itself felt a little mismanaged. The first thing we noted when arriving was the lack of shade in the car park. Poor Fran spent the next 5 days cooking outside on an asphalt parking lot. I know we were in the desert but some trees or shade cloth would have been useful. </p><p>The air-conditioning broke multiple times in their communal areas/restaurants and also on the hottest bus ever to transport us to the Sounds of Silence dinner: not a great impression to make on foreign tourists paying hundreds of dollars for the experience. We suggest you bring a nice bottle of wine (or two) as the bottle shop offers a very limited, bad wine range at expensive prices. Food outlets and restaurants are the same. </p><p>All of that aside we did enjoy our stay and the staff at the resort were all amazing, working hard to provide the best experience possible, when they themselves were sweating from the lack of an air-conditioned work environment. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_2002.jpg" width="1500" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="Central Australia Road Trip (Pt.1): Broken Hill, Coober Pedy &amp; Uluru" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_2002.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_2002.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_2002.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_2007.jpg" width="1500" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="Central Australia Road Trip (Pt.1): Broken Hill, Coober Pedy &amp; Uluru" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_2007.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_2007.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_2007.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1921.jpg" width="1500" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="Central Australia Road Trip (Pt.1): Broken Hill, Coober Pedy &amp; Uluru" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1921.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_1921.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1921.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1942.jpg" width="1000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="Central Australia Road Trip (Pt.1): Broken Hill, Coober Pedy &amp; Uluru" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1942.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1942.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><p>Our days were built around avoiding the peak temperatures of the day as afternoons were just too hot to do anything productive. So we usually had something planned for the mornings and evenings and spent the middle of the day not too far from the pool :-)</p><p>One of the highlights was definitely the <a href="https://www.ayersrockresort.com.au/experiences/detail/sounds-of-silence?ref=localhost">Sounds of Silence</a> dinner. While it&#x2019;s certainly not a cheap night out, it was a good night. The evening starts with drinks and canapes at a spot with a good view of the both Uluru and The Olgas. We stayed there until sunset and then walked down a short path to where dinner is served under the stars. The dinner is a buffet but the food was actually pretty good and catered for all dietary requirements. Wine and beer was also free flowing. After dinner is a &#x2018;guided tour of the night sky&#x2019; (their words, not mine) which was a great experience except maybe a little rushed. Overall it&#x2019;s an experience we would recommend if you can part with the money, even if it does feel like the organisers are phoning it in a little at times.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1874.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Central Australia Road Trip (Pt.1): Broken Hill, Coober Pedy &amp; Uluru" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1874.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_1874.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1874.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1886.jpg" width="1500" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="Central Australia Road Trip (Pt.1): Broken Hill, Coober Pedy &amp; Uluru" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1886.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_1886.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1886.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191226_193117.jpg" width="1434" height="1434" loading="lazy" alt="Central Australia Road Trip (Pt.1): Broken Hill, Coober Pedy &amp; Uluru" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20191226_193117.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_20191226_193117.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191226_193117.jpg 1434w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1887.jpg" width="1500" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="Central Australia Road Trip (Pt.1): Broken Hill, Coober Pedy &amp; Uluru" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1887.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_1887.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1887.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><p>Obviously you can&#x2019;t come all the way to Uluru without seeing the rock at both sunrise and sunset. We did sunset multiple times (easy if you have your own vehicle, but also possible to organise through he resort) and sunrise just the once.</p><p>Passes to Ulu&#x1E5F;u-Kata Tju&#x1E6F;a National Park can be purchased through <a href="https://book.parksaustralia.gov.au/passes/uluru/?ref=localhost">Parks Australia</a> and cost us 25AUD each for up to 5 days.</p><p>Our sunrise was on a morning when there had been a rare case of rain. Fortunately the rain cleared as we headed out to the rock. Unfortunately we didn&#x2019;t really get a true sunrise because of the cloud. Still it was beautiful and worth the early start. </p><p>Tip: The best spot to photograph the rock at the sunrise viewing area (Talinguru Nyakunytjaku) is actually not on the platform but from the ground closer to the rock. We found the platform to be crowded and had obstructions in the view.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1988.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Central Australia Road Trip (Pt.1): Broken Hill, Coober Pedy &amp; Uluru" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1988.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_1988.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1988.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1967.jpg" width="790" height="790" loading="lazy" alt="Central Australia Road Trip (Pt.1): Broken Hill, Coober Pedy &amp; Uluru" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1967.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1967.jpg 790w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1971.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="Central Australia Road Trip (Pt.1): Broken Hill, Coober Pedy &amp; Uluru" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1971.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1971.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><p>We also did a couple of walks, again in the mornings before it got too hot.</p><p>One morning we did the walk around the rock (approx. 8km), a pleasant walk with a designated path.

In hindsight we shouldn&#x2019;t have left that until the last night as we had no opportunity to reschedule when it did get cancelled.

Singaporeans almost treat shopping as a sport and therefore it is no surprise that there is no shortage of great places to shop. </p><p><a href="https://www.visitsingapore.com/en_au/see-do-singapore/places-to-see/orchard/?ref=localhost">Orchard Road</a> is perhaps Singapore&#x2019;s most famous shopping destination and this street alone provides many hours of opportunities to spend money, the street lined with malls featuring designer brands and department stores, as well as a variety of bars and restaurants. <a href="https://www.vivocity.com.sg/?ref=localhost">VivoCity</a> is Singapore&#x2019;s largest shopping mall, again filled with a variety of shops as well as outlets and entertainment. Another favourite is <a href="https://www.marinabaysands.com/shopping.html?ref=localhost">The Shoppes at Mariana Bay Sands</a>, the architecture adding to the impressiveness of the high end names and designer brands. Singapore has also cemented its name as a shopping destination by adding <a href="https://www.changiairport.com/en/discover/jewel.html?ref=localhost">The Jewel</a> (pictured below) to it&#x2019;s Changi Airport. </p><p>If malls are not your thing, do not despair. Singapore offers plenty of outdoor and unique shopping opportunities via its outdoor markets (e.g. Bugis Street Market, Chinatown), busy roads (Serangoon Road, Little India) and little laneways such as Haji Lane (more on these <a href="https://www.abandonism.com/blog/ten-things-to-do-singapore?ref=localhost#neighbourhood">further below</a>).       </p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191111_183446.jpg" width="1500" height="1125" loading="lazy" alt="Ten things to do in Singapore" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20191111_183446.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_20191111_183446.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191111_183446.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191111_183518-01.jpg" width="1500" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="Ten things to do in Singapore" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20191111_183518-01.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_20191111_183518-01.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191111_183518-01.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="marina-bay">MARINA BAY</h2><p><a href="https://www.visitsingapore.com/en_au/see-do-singapore/places-to-see/marina-bay-area/?ref=localhost">Marina Bay</a> is an upscale area of skyscrapers, posh hotels and luxury malls all on a waterfront promenade featuring the iconic Marina Bay Sands; three towers topped off with an infinity pool that has become a well known feature of Singapore&#x2019;s skyline.</p><p>Marina Bay has plenty to see and do, offering a bit of everything from shopping and food, to gardens and cruises.</p><p>But we can&#x2019;t talk about Marina Bay without including more on <a href="https://www.marinabaysands.com/?ref=localhost">Marina Bay Sands</a> itself. Firstly, this hotel gets super busy and it is not cheap. The infinity pool located 57 stories up is only available to hotel guests, so if you&#x2019;re like us and can&#x2019;t fork out the cash for your entire Singapore stay at the Marina Bay Sands, book in a single night only and get your Instagram pics in the famous pool. And if a single night is still a bit out of your budget then don&#x2019;t worry - you can still get the same incredible view for a small entrance fee at the <a href="https://www.marinabaysands.com/attractions/sands-skypark.html?ref=localhost">Sands SkyPark Observation Deck</a>, on the same level as the pool.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20170827_123526.jpg" width="1500" height="1125" loading="lazy" alt="Ten things to do in Singapore" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20170827_123526.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_20170827_123526.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20170827_123526.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20170827_130052.jpg" width="1500" height="1125" loading="lazy" alt="Ten things to do in Singapore" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20170827_130052.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_20170827_130052.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20170827_130052.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20170827_170735.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Ten things to do in Singapore" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20170827_170735.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_20170827_170735.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20170827_170735.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="visit-one-of-singapores-neighbourhoods">VISIT ONE OF SINGAPORE&apos;S NEIGHBOURHOODS</h2><p>Singapore is home to an array of diverse <a href="https://www.visitsingapore.com/see-do-singapore/neighbourhoods/?ref=localhost">neighbourhoods</a>, each offering something different in the way of history and attractions, food and culture. Each time we visit Singapore we try to visit at least one or two that we haven&#x2019;t been to before, or sometimes just re-visit an old favourite.</p><p>Below are some of our favourite and most recommended neighbourhoods, as well as others to check out.</p><p><strong>Favourites:</strong></p><p><strong>Little India</strong> - Colourful and vibrant. The little lanes make walking easy while exploring the fascinating street art and historic temples, taking in the smells of spices and food.  </p><p><strong>Chinatown</strong> - The streets of Chinatown are a blend of old and new. The evidence of old Chinatown are evident via the buildings and temples and there is a Chinatown Heritage Centre to learn more about the early Chinese migrants to Singapore. Chinatown is perhaps the best area to steal a bargain if you&#x2019;re a shopper but the attraction for us is definitely the food. A mix of cool restaurants and market/ hawker centre stalls mean there are food options at all price points and to suit everyone&#x2019;s taste.</p><p><strong>Kampong Gelam</strong> - Quirky, colourful and interesting, this neighbourhood is my personal favourite. The area, sometimes referred to as the Arab Quarter, is located around the Sultan Mosque and there is no shortage of cool bars and eateries, funky boutiques and unique stores and it&#x2019;s difficult to not fall in love with the vibrant laneways such as Haji Lane. </p><p><strong>Others to check out:</strong> <strong>Colonial/ Civic District </strong>for the historic buildings, memorials and museums; <strong>Joo Chiat</strong> for the vibrant shophouses and Peranakan culture; and <strong>Tiong Bahru</strong> for its architecture, history and hip shops.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1562.jpg" width="999" height="999" loading="lazy" alt="Ten things to do in Singapore" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1562.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1562.jpg 999w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1571.jpg" width="999" height="999" loading="lazy" alt="Ten things to do in Singapore" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1571.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1571.jpg 999w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191110_125553.jpg" width="1125" height="1125" loading="lazy" alt="Ten things to do in Singapore" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20191110_125553.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_20191110_125553.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191110_125553.jpg 1125w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1520-1.jpg" width="999" height="999" loading="lazy" alt="Ten things to do in Singapore" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1520-1.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1520-1.jpg 999w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1526-1.jpg" width="999" height="999" loading="lazy" alt="Ten things to do in Singapore" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1526-1.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1526-1.jpg 999w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1601.jpg" width="999" height="999" loading="lazy" alt="Ten things to do in Singapore" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1601.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1601.jpg 999w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="indulge-in-singapore%E2%80%99s-food-culture">INDULGE IN SINGAPORE&#x2019;S FOOD CULTURE</h2><p>Singapore has an amazing food culture.

Another winner we discovered was <a href="https://wildhoney.com.sg/?ref=localhost">Wild Honey</a> which has yummo food and a liquor license, great for a boozy brunch.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20170827_100522-2.jpg" width="1125" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="Ten things to do in Singapore" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20170827_100522-2.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_20170827_100522-2.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20170827_100522-2.jpg 1125w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20170826_150412.jpg" width="1125" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="Ten things to do in Singapore" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20170826_150412.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_20170826_150412.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20170826_150412.jpg 1125w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20170827_145846.jpg" width="1500" height="1125" loading="lazy" alt="Ten things to do in Singapore" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20170827_145846.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_20170827_145846.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20170827_145846.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20180305_141032.jpg" width="1125" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="Ten things to do in Singapore" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20180305_141032.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_20180305_141032.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20180305_141032.jpg 1125w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20170827_224142.jpg" width="1125" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="Ten things to do in Singapore" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20170827_224142.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_20170827_224142.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20170827_224142.jpg 1125w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20170826_102403-1.jpg" width="1500" height="1125" loading="lazy" alt="Ten things to do in Singapore" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20170826_102403-1.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_20170826_102403-1.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20170826_102403-1.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="check-out-the-amazing-bar-scene">CHECK OUT THE AMAZING BAR SCENE</h2><p>Any list we provide here for Singapore&#x2019;s bars we know is going to be out of date pretty much as soon as we write it. That said, there&#x2019;s a few bars we&#x2019;ve made repeat visits to that we have included below, as well as a link to a really good resource that is kept up to date.</p><p>Singapore&#x2019;s bar scene really is amazing with its top quality drinks, inventive fit outs, ambiance and just outright coolness. That all said, drinking in Singapore doesn&#x2019;t come cheap which is why if you are ready for a good night out, choose well.</p><p>Our two repeat bars are 28 HongKong Street and The Other Room.</p><p><a href="https://28hks.com/?ref=localhost">28 Hong Kong Street</a> is one of Singapore&#x2019;s first speakeasy bars and can be tricky to find behind the unmarked shopfront door on Hong Kong Street. But go inside and you&#x2019;ll find cool tunes and shelves lined with top shelf drinks ready to mix up creative cocktails. </p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheOtherRoomSG">The Other Room</a> is another bar hidden away behind an unmarked door, this time inside the Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel. Press the buzzer and you&#x2019;ll be welcomed into an intimate bar with an almost overwhelming choice of cocktails and quality liquors.</p><p>Not a bar, but also one we have given repeat business is <a href="https://www.boomarang.com.sg/?ref=localhost">Boomarang</a> in Robertson Quay. We like this place not because it&#x2019;s an Australian bar but because it is a bit more casual and has a lovely location on the river, great for a quiet afternoon drink. I&#x2019;ll also admit we came across Boomarang when I was looking for somewhere to watch an AFL game that I really didn&#x2019;t want to miss. Boomarang is also good for live sport.</p><p>Just for a completeness we&#x2019;ve added a few bars that are currently on our wish list and as we do finally get to them, will update this page. Our wish list is (in no particular order): <a href="http://atlasbar.sg/?ref=localhost">Atlas Bar</a> (Rochor), <a href="https://www.theoldmansg.com/?ref=localhost">The Old Man</a> (China Town),  <a href="http://employeesonlysg.com/?ref=localhost">Employees Only</a> (Chinatown), <a href="https://www.level33.com.sg/?ref=localhost">LeVel33</a> (Marina Bay) and <a href="https://www.raffles.com/singapore/dining/long-bar/?ref=localhost">Raffles Long Bar</a> ( the home of the Singapore Sling)</p><p>Also refer to Timeout for an up to date list of the best bars in <a href="https://www.timeout.com/singapore/bars-and-pubs/best-bars-in-singapore?ref=localhost">Singapore</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20180305_215012.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Ten things to do in Singapore" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20180305_215012.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_20180305_215012.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20180305_215012.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="enjoy-singapore%E2%80%99s-parks-and-gardens">ENJOY SINGAPORE&#x2019;S PARKS AND GARDENS</h2><p>One of the most surprising things for many visitors coming to Singapore is the amount of green.

Refer to<a href="https://theculturetrip.com/asia/singapore/articles/the-10-most-beautiful-parks-and-gardens-in-singapore/?ref=localhost"> this list of parks</a> for some ideas. Some of our own favourites that are city central are the Singapore Botanic Gardens and Fort Canning Park.</p><h2 id="clarke-quay">CLARKE QUAY</h2><p>Clarke Quay might seem an odd choice to go in our top ten and we won&#x2019;t lie, it&#x2019;s very touristy. But we&#x2019;ve included it because it is a nice place to walk along during the day (and you can also include Boat Quay for that as well), and it&#x2019;s a great place for a drink in the evening.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20170826_221433.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Ten things to do in Singapore" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20170826_221433.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_20170826_221433.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20170826_221433.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>We usually stay around the Clarke Quay area because it feels so central to other places we will visit while in Singapore. Chinatown is within walking distance, Roberston Quay is close for more food and drink options, Marina Bay is not too far and there&#x2019;s also great transport options with the MRT. But Clarke Quay is nice within its own right because you can stay local and still take in all of the energy of the party goers in the evening. You have lots of food and drinking options, you can take a boat ride on the river (admittedly we&#x2019;ve never actually done this), it&#x2019;s great for a morning run and there&#x2019;s some good shopping options there as well. #winning</p><h2 id="take-in-the-arts-culture">TAKE IN THE ARTS &amp; CULTURE</h2><p>Something that is less spoken about (well at least from a tourist&#x2019;s perspective) is Singapore&#x2019;s arts and culture scene, which makes sense when you think about Singapore as a mix of cultures and histories.</p><p>Singapore has a wide choice of galleries, museums and temples and we have barely made a dent in all that it has to offer.</p><p>Some of the temples we think are worth checking out include : Thian Hock Keng Temple (Chinatown), Sri Mariamman Temple (Chinatown), Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple (Little India/ Rochor) and Buddha Tooth Relic Temple &amp; Museum (Chinatown).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1500.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Ten things to do in Singapore" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1500.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_1500.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1500.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple (Little India/ Rochor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For art try the <a href="https://www.operagallery.com/?ref=localhost">Opera Gallery</a>, <a href="https://www.gillmanbarracks.com/?ref=localhost">Gillman Barraks</a> (made up of 10 galleries) and <a href="https://deck.sg/?ref=localhost">Deck</a> for photographic art.</p><p>Oh, and don&#x2019;t forget about the urban street art in some of <a href="https://www.abandonism.com/blog/ten-things-to-do-singapore?ref=localhost#neighbourhood">Singapore&#x2019;s Neighbourhoods</a>.

There are three main heritage centres that will give you the history and insight into the country&#x2019;s main cultures - the <a href="https://www.indianheritage.org.sg/en?ref=localhost">Indian Heritage Centre</a>, <a href="https://www.malayheritage.org.sg/en?ref=localhost">Malay Heritage Centre</a> and <a href="https://chc.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/Home.aspx?ref=localhost">Chinese Heritage Centre</a>. Finally there is the <a href="https://www.nhb.gov.sg/nationalmuseum/?ref=localhost">National Museum of Singapore</a> which was established in 1887 and is Singapore&#x2019;s oldest museum.</p><p></p><p>As you can see, there is a lot to see and do in Singapore and every visit we make we find more.

Then pretty much a pub and bar crawl over the following days up and around Pub Street. One place that did stand out and a little away from the main area was Temple Skylounge.  </p><p>Temple Skylounge has a mixture of businesses in the complex including a bakery (ground floor), restaurant and then a rooftop bar. The view is of the town is great and the cocktails were impressive. We were there pretty early in the evening but it looked like it might get pretty party later in the night (Note: Do not confuse this Temple bar with the Temple Nightclub in Pub Street).</p><h2 id="what-we-did">WHAT WE DID</h2><h3 id="siem-reap-town-including-pub-street">SIEM REAP TOWN (INCLUDING PUB STREET)</h3><p>We generally like to start our time in a new location getting a feel for the place and just walking around, which is what we did in Siem Reap.</p><p>The main tourist area is pretty laid back during the day and becomes party at night. We checked out the little lane ways in the main tourist area, visited the old market, walked along the river up to the Royal Residence and Preah Ang Chorm Shrine and basically just took in the town.</p><p>Pub Street is blocked off to traffic at night which is great for the hoards of people eating, drinking and having fun at one of the many bars, clubs and restaurants along the strip. The area felt very safe although as with any poorer country we did spot homeless people and children selling goods way past their bed time.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/2020-05-15.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Siem Reap" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/2020-05-15.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/2020-05-15.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2025/06/2020-05-15.jpg 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w2400/2025/06/2020-05-15.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_0996.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="Siem Reap" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_0996.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_0996.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1421.jpg" width="999" height="999" loading="lazy" alt="Siem Reap" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1421.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1421.jpg 999w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1425.jpg" width="999" height="999" loading="lazy" alt="Siem Reap" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1425.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1425.jpg 999w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1439.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="Siem Reap" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1439.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1439.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1433.jpg" width="1500" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="Siem Reap" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1433.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_1433.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1433.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1435.jpg" width="1500" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="Siem Reap" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1435.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_1435.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1435.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><h3 id="angkor-archeological-park">ANGKOR ARCHEOLOGICAL PARK</h3><p>First thing first. There are a few ticket options for visiting Angkor Wat, so choose according to how much time you want to spend there. Passes are sold in one-day (37USD), three-day (62USD) and seven-day (72USD) blocks that <u>must be used on consecutive days</u>. Passes are also specific to you and a photo is taken on the spot to attach at the time of purchase. We did a 3 day pass which worked well for the time we were there and gave us more than enough time to see what we wanted to see. Before leaving I read blogs with people spending a week or more there and travelling to some of the further out temples - that was not for us. By day 3 we were a little &#x2018;templed out&#x2019;, as much as we loved the temples because they are pretty awesome.</p><p>Also, the ticket office is a 15 min drive away from the Angkor Wat main gate, so make sure you or your driver remember to stop there first before heading to the main site.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/_MG_5628.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Siem Reap" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/_MG_5628.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/_MG_5628.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/_MG_5632.jpg" width="999" height="999" loading="lazy" alt="Siem Reap" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/_MG_5632.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/_MG_5632.jpg 999w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1181.jpg" width="999" height="999" loading="lazy" alt="Siem Reap" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1181.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1181.jpg 999w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1103.jpg" width="999" height="999" loading="lazy" alt="Siem Reap" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1103.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1103.jpg 999w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1303.jpg" width="999" height="999" loading="lazy" alt="Siem Reap" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1303.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1303.jpg 999w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><p>Angkor Archeological Park has two main circuits that people generally stick to - The Small Circuit which consists of Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom, plus the Ta Prohm (Aka. the Tomb Raider temple) and a few others. Then there is the Grand Circuit which covers some of the further away temples. If you are there for only a day then the Small Circuit is definitely your best option. Start with the main two sites and choose from the rest based on time. If you have 2-3 days then you will have more than enough time to cover the Grand Circuit and maybe a coupe of others outside of it, like we did.</p><p>Going in our plan was to complete the Small Circuit on day one, sunrise at Angkor Wat Temple followed by the remaining temples in the Grand Circuit day two and a couple on the way to visit a floating village on day three. Mostly we stuck to this plan except that on day one we ran out of time for some of the temples on the Small Circuit so had to push them to day two, and our sunrise at Angkor Wat was a bit of a disaster.</p><p>#sunrisefail</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1210.jpg" width="1500" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="Siem Reap" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1210.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_1210.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1210.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1219.jpg" width="1500" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="Siem Reap" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1219.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_1219.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1219.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><p>The sunrise at Angkor Wat on day two was a non-event with foggy conditions and obviously, no sun.

We like to do this to get a feel for the place we are staying before jumping straight into &#x2018;tourist&#x2019; type activities.</p><p><strong>Day 3 &amp; 4 -</strong> Explore Angkor Archaeological Park. We started with the Angkor Wat Temple and then Angkor Thom on the first day, moving around the Angkor &#x2018;Small Circuit&#x2019;. On the second morning (day 4) we began with sunrise at Angkor Wat Temple and then moved our explorations to the &#x2018;Grand Circuit&#x2019;.</p><p><strong>Day 5 - </strong>This day we visited a couple more temples, Preah Koh and the Bakong Temples, on the way to visit the floating village Kompong Phluk. </p><p><strong>Day 6 -</strong> Morning transfer from Siem Reap to <a href="https://www.abandonism.com/blog/phnom-penh?ref=localhost">Phnom Penh</a>. Afternoon exploring the Phnom Penh  historic district.</p><p><strong>Day 7 -</strong> Explore Phnom Penh City.</p><p><strong>Day 8 -</strong> Half day visit to Killing Fields of Choeung Ek and Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum.

We went there for a 3 night visit after <a href="https://www.abandonism.com/blog/siemreap?ref=localhost">our time in Siem Reap</a> and were pleasantly surprised at how cosmopolitan it is all the while retaining the energy of a South-East Asian capital city.</p><h2 id="how-we-got-there">HOW WE GOT THERE</h2><p>This a heading I don&#x2019;t always include however we had such a good experience with the transfer company we used that I feel like they deserve a mention. </p><p>First I should note, we had actually planned to take a bus for our transfer from Siem Reap to Phnom Penh, but as with most of our trips, we were time poor and didn&#x2019;t want to lose an entire day of our week in Cambodia to a bus ride. So we did a bit of research and came across a local company called <a href="https://bookmebus.com/en?ref=localhost">BookMeBus</a>, a leading bus ticket booking site, and start up, in Cambodia. As the name says you can book buses, however we used them to book a private taxi. Following what was a painless booking process and confirmation, our driver turned up 15 mins early with a comfortable and clean car. Our driver didn&#x2019;t really speak any English but that also wasn&#x2019;t a problem as he used a translation app to communicate with us and he drove incredibly safely. The cost of the transfer was around 100AUD, possibly on the pricer side but with only one quick stop we made it our our accommodation in Phnom Penh in 5 hours and had the entire afternoon to start checking it out, so we bought quite a lot of time back. Worth it!</p><h2 id="where-we-stayed">WHERE WE STAYED</h2><p>We stayed at a small hotel in the historic district of Phnom Penh, <a href="https://maads.asia/bluelime?ref=localhost">Blue Lime</a>. The hotel is down a quiet lane and is a bit of an oasis with its pool and gardens, all the while located close to key landmarks and great eating options. I think we paid around 80AUD per night with breakfast, again not super cheap but good value for its comfort and location. We would stay there again.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191105_124209.jpg" width="1500" height="1125" loading="lazy" alt="Phnom Penh" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20191105_124209.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_20191105_124209.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191105_124209.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191105_165234.jpg" width="1125" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="Phnom Penh" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20191105_165234.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_20191105_165234.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191105_165234.jpg 1125w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="where-we-ate-and-drank">WHERE WE ATE AND DRANK</h2><p>One of the most surprising things about Phnom Penh was the food and bar scene.

This covers the National Museum (although we did this the following day), the Royal Palace and Sisowath Quay Boardwalk.</p><p>The <strong>Sisowath Quay Boardwalk</strong> was a pretty chilled area to go for a walk (once you managed to cross the road and avoid the bikes). The Mekong River is not especially beautiful as rivers go but it was nice to go for a walk and would be a great place to run if you are a keen runner.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1455.jpg" width="1500" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="Phnom Penh" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1455.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_1455.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1455.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1458.jpg" width="1500" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="Phnom Penh" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1458.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_1458.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1458.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1450.jpg" width="1500" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="Phnom Penh" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_1450.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_1450.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_1450.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><p>I&#x2019;ll admit now that we didn&#x2019;t end up going into the <strong>Royal Palace</strong>.

When purchasing tickets (10USDpp) we also purchased a couple of audio guides (5USDpp) which was worth the extra money. There are so many sculptures, pottery, bronzes, etc from various ages and even though the museum does work in a chronological direction, it would be incredibly difficult to follow without the audio guide.

In preparation for our Cambodia trip we had tried to brush up a little on our Cambodian history, but even so nothing can fully prepare you for the stories shared at the Killing Fields and the S21 prison (see next paragraph). I&#x2019;m not going to go into the story of the fields on this blog as you can get a much better understanding via one of the many books or movies that covers the history of the Cambodia genocide. What I will say is that the site is a peaceful place today and well worth a visit. The admission fee, which was about 6USD, includes a really great audio tour and the tour overall is respectfully put together.</p><p>We hired a motorbike taxi for half a day to do both the Killing fields and S21 and paid around 20USD, good value considering the fields are about 45 mins out of the city.      </p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191107_112521.jpg" width="1125" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="Phnom Penh" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20191107_112521.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_20191107_112521.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191107_112521.jpg 1125w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191107_111342.jpg" width="1125" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="Phnom Penh" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20191107_111342.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_20191107_111342.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20191107_111342.jpg 1125w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><h3 id="tuol-sleng-genocide-museum-s21-prison">TUOL SLENG GENOCIDE MUSEUM/ S21 PRISON</h3><p>We visited the Killing Fields prior to <a href="https://tuolsleng.gov.kh/en/?ref=localhost">Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum</a> and just when you think the stories can&#x2019;t get more horrifying comes this high school turned prison.</p><p>The cost of the museum entrance for a non-Cambodian citizen was 3USD plus another 3USD for an audio guide, the audio guide once more well worth the extra few dollars.</p><p>Again, I won&#x2019;t go into the history of the site or the Khmer Rouge regime as there are much better, more reliable sources you can refer to than anything I would put together.

I&apos;m sad to think it&apos;s taken me so long! True, I have only been to Queenstown, but if this is any indication of what the rest of the country is like we need to get Fran over there ASAP and do a drive across the country.&#xA0;</p><p>In the meantime however, I have been only to Queenstown and I&apos;m&#xA0;glad we went. Even if you&apos;re not a great skier like me (and if you are like Mike), there&apos;s so much to do in Queenstown and the surrounds, it&apos;s a great introduction to New Zealand regardless of season.&#xA0;</p><p>Probably one thing I was surprised about (and now I&apos;m not sure why) is how touristy the town is. It&apos;s not cheap and the service often reflects the fact that it is a tourist hotspot. However the beauty of Lake&#xA0;Wakatipu&#xA0;and the surrounding mountains makes up for it, as does the quality of the food and wine!&#xA0;</p><p>Flying in (and out) of Queenstown is also pretty amazing. We arrived at night time on the way in and couldn&apos;t see anything, however flying out over all of the snowcapped mountains was truly incredible.&#xA0;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190821_122425-66.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Queenstown" loading="lazy" width="600" height="800" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190821_122425-66.jpg 600w"></figure><p>&#xA0;</p><h2 id="where-we-stayed">WHERE WE STAYED&#xA0;</h2><p>We stayed at <a href="https://www.lomondlodge.com/?ref=localhost">Lomond Lodge</a>.&#xA0;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190819_172739-28.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Queenstown" loading="lazy" width="800" height="600" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20190819_172739-28.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190819_172739-28.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The location was really good, close to all amenities&#xA0;and the rooms were nice. Would we stay there again? Probably not. To be fair, in the lead up to the stay, the hotel provided us with some good information. But the service at the Lodge itself was not great, there was rarely anyone in the office who could assist us. We only hired a car for the day, but if you had a car, there is a daily rate for parking. The bed was extremely hot to sleep in and housekeeping was &apos;opt in&apos; not the usual &apos;opt out&apos;. Oh, and they had a Nespresso machine there but only provide capsules for the first night of our stay. Strange?! Probably should just remove the machine altogether.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p>In short, we knew that Lomond Lodge was mid-budget for Queenstown&#xA0;and our expectations were in check, but due to really bad sleeps and just poor guest experience, I&apos;d opt for somewhere else next time.&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><h2 id="where-we-ate">WHERE WE ATE&#xA0;</h2><p>It&apos;s a good thing we were in Queenstown for less than a week because the holiday calories were adding up fast with so much good food and drink.&#xA0;</p><p>On the night we arrived we did the mandatory&#xA0;<a href="https://www.fergburger.com/?ref=localhost">Fergburger</a>&#xA0;stop. Unfortunately we didn&#x2019;t get a photo of our burgers but they were epic! This place is an institution and the burgers are pretty damn good. It&apos;s not where you go for a relaxed meal, it&apos;s kind of&#xA0;eat&#xA0;and leave which you understand when you see the line out the door.&#xA0;</p><p>Probably the best meal we had in Queenstown was at <a href="https://thefatlamb.co.nz/?ref=localhost">The Fat Lamb</a>. We ordered the roast lamb for two because it seemed the thing to do and we were not disappointed. While it wasn&apos;t cheap, there was so much food and the lamb was cooked well, so it was good value. We also made a good attempt at getting through their drinks list &#x1F92D; tasting some great pinot noirs. The staff were very&#xA0;knowledgeable on their menus and probably the best service we received in Queenstown itself.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190818_192052-17.jpg" width="600" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Queenstown" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190818_192052-17.jpg 600w"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190819_220128-30.jpg" width="600" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Queenstown" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190819_220128-30.jpg 600w"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190819_223724-31.jpg" width="800" height="600" loading="lazy" alt="Queenstown" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20190819_223724-31.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190819_223724-31.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190820_140752-45.jpg" width="600" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Queenstown" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190820_140752-45.jpg 600w"></div></div></div></figure><p>The one place we had booked in advance was <a href="https://www.botswanabutchery.co.nz/queenstown/?ref=localhost">Botswana Butchery</a>. I had read some reviews and really just loved the name given our time in Southern Africa.&#xA0;</p><p>Botswana Butchery is located in what appears to be an old style house that looks out onto the lake. As we were there at night and it was dark, a lake view seat wouldn&apos;t have been much good anyway, but if I went back, I&apos;d definitely request this.&#xA0;</p><p>Food here was pricey but good. They have some less common meats on their menu so for anyone looking to try something a little bit different, this is definitely the place to do it. They also have a great wine menu!&#xA0;</p><p>Our day in the Otago wine region we lunched at <a href="https://www.gibbstonvalley.com/au/?ref=localhost">Gibbston Valley Wines</a>, ordering their cheese and&#xA0;charcuterie&#xA0;board. We also ordered chips which we really didn&apos;t need. There was so much food, all really great quality.&#xA0;</p><p>Where we did less well was on breakfast. We frequented a couple of the cheap bakeries on our snow days but on the other days didn&apos;t really come across anything&#xA0;noteworthy&#xA0;(or with great coffee). I&apos;d say there&apos;s a good business opportunity in that space for anyone who is keen!&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><h2 id="what-we-did">WHAT WE DID&#xA0;</h2><h3 id="out-and-about-in-queenstown">&#xA0;OUT AND ABOUT IN QUEENSTOWN&#xA0;</h3><p>Our first day was spent just wandering around the town itself. We&#xA0;hadn&apos;t hired a car at this point and we had a couple of errands to run to prepare for our ski days, so we took the opportunity to just explore the town.&#xA0;</p><p>A lot of the key spots in the town are based around Lake Wakatipu, so we went for a long walk around the lake area, taking in the surrounding mountains and hanging out with the ducks.&#xA0;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190817_135124-6.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Queenstown" loading="lazy" width="800" height="600" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20190817_135124-6.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190817_135124-6.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>In Queenstown Gardens we actually were a little confused by these weird looking contraptions, initially ignoring them but&#xA0;realising&#xA0;later they were for &apos;Frisbee golf&apos; (or disc golf). If we had worked it out a bit earlier we would have had a go; you can hire the&#xA0;discs for Frisbee golf for $5.00 each from the Queenstown Ice Arena. But by the time we had gone all the way around the gardens we were keen for a coffee.&#xA0;</p><p>Back in town we walked around to the wharf and watched the ferries come in and out. In hindsight we should have jumped on one as I think this would be a nice relaxing way to enjoy the lake, definitely something I would do next time.&#xA0;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190817_140709-13.jpg" width="800" height="600" loading="lazy" alt="Queenstown" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20190817_140709-13.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190817_140709-13.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190819_154140-25.jpg" width="800" height="600" loading="lazy" alt="Queenstown" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20190819_154140-25.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190819_154140-25.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190819_152849-24.jpg" width="800" height="600" loading="lazy" alt="Queenstown" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20190819_152849-24.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190819_152849-24.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190817_135626-8.jpg" width="600" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Queenstown" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190817_135626-8.jpg 600w"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/_MG_5564-2.jpg" width="800" height="533" loading="lazy" alt="Queenstown" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/_MG_5564-2.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/_MG_5564-2.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190817_140621-12.jpg" width="600" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Queenstown" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190817_140621-12.jpg 600w"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190817_135118-5.jpg" width="800" height="600" loading="lazy" alt="Queenstown" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20190817_135118-5.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190817_135118-5.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190819_155629-26.jpg" width="800" height="600" loading="lazy" alt="Queenstown" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20190819_155629-26.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190819_155629-26.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><p>As we were there on a Saturday, the&#xA0;Creative&#xA0;Queenstown&#xA0;Arts &amp; Crafts&#xA0;Market&#xA0;was on with the perfect waterfront setting, located in/ around&#xA0;Earnslaw&#xA0;Park.

All in all it worked out ok, but below I have included a couple of hints/ tips that I would abide by next time.&#xA0;</p><p>Before we left we had booked all of our ski&#xA0;equipment, bus transfers&#xA0;and lift passes through <a href="https://www.infosnow.co.nz/?ref=localhost">Info Snow</a>. It made it easy to do from Australia but didn&apos;t come cheap. I think for 2 days we paid&#xA0;AUD765&#xA0;for the 2 of us.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p>What we didn&apos;t&#xA0;realise&#xA0;until we went to pick everything up, is that basically they are just coordinating it for you. We were handed vouchers for the lift passes and equipment which we then had to go to separate locations to&#xA0;arrange. It did help a little, but not a lot. The bus service is also a once a day return trip, so if you decide to leave a little earlier (which we did on the second day), you need to go through a different bus company and pay.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p><em>HINT:</em>&#xA0;If we were to do this again&#xA0;I would hire the equipment in town and go directly through Coronet Peak office to arrange the passes .&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p><em>HINT:</em>&#xA0;Use the Coronet Peak bus&#xA0;which you can also purchase a ticket for <a href="https://www.coronetpeak.co.nz/transport/?ref=localhost">online</a> or at their Queenstown office. This bus runs every 20 or so minutes in the morning and after 2pm buses run as they fill up. This is good for getting in the morning session and then leaving mid-afternoon if the mountain becomes icy or the weather turns. They also run a hotel pick up service.&#xA0;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190819_105740-20.jpg" width="800" height="600" loading="lazy" alt="Queenstown" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20190819_105740-20.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190819_105740-20.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190819_105749-21.jpg" width="800" height="600" loading="lazy" alt="Queenstown" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20190819_105749-21.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190819_105749-21.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><p>I can definitely see the attraction of Coronet Peak for more seasoned skiers. Plenty of runs at different levels and plenty of space. We were told that the season hadn&apos;t been good and that was obvious from the snow machines running in the morning and the ice, but I can imagine that on a good year it would be great skiing.&#xA0;</p><p>As a beginner there was the &apos;very beginner&apos; area with the mats which was really good to practice on until it got extremely busy (it&apos;s not a very large area). There is only really one green run and I found it challenging at my level but Mike enjoyed some of the other runs, again they were just a bit icy.&#xA0;</p><p>In regards to facilities on the mountain, you do have everything you&apos;ll need in the way of hire, lockers, plenty of bathrooms and a large canteen area.&#xA0;</p><p><em>HINT:</em>&#xA0;If you&apos;re definitely coming back the following day you can pay NZD5 to have them hold your skis overnight which makes the bus&#xA0;so much easier.&#xA0;Cash&#xA0;only though.&#xA0;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190819_133132-23.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Queenstown" loading="lazy" width="800" height="600" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20190819_133132-23.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190819_133132-23.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I was a bit disappointed that there wasn&apos;t really anywhere &apos;nice&apos; to sit after I&apos;d had enough for the day and Mike wanted to keep going.

Coronet Peak doesn&apos;t have this, there is space to sit but it&apos;s a bit like sitting in a food court.&#xA0;</p><p>In summary, Coronet Peak is great for seasoned skiers and easy to&#xA0;organise&#xA0;from Queenstown.&#xA0;</p><h3 id="otago-wine-region">OTAGO WINE REGION&#xA0;</h3><p>On our last full day in Queenstown we hired a car&#xA0;so we could check out the Otago wine region and surrounds.

Queenstown is expensive and a very touristy area. That said I would still love to come back in the warmer months and do a hike or two and maybe explore New Zealand a bit further.

The nation&apos;s capital isn&apos;t short of things to do and see, with something for everyone and for every season. Below are ten of our favourites, in no particular order.</p><h2 id="1-lake-burley-griffin">1. Lake Burley Griffin&#xA0;&#xA0;</h2><p>At the heart of Canberra, Lake Burley Griffin is a beautiful place to be in any season (although dress warm on those frosty Canberra days). Go for a stroll, or run, around the approximately 5 km central loop or grab a bike and go for a ride around one of the large loops. The lake is a lovely place to have a picnic or stop for a coffee. Also check out the National Carillon, situated on Aspen Island and the regular chimes.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190608_165627-14.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Ten things to do in Canberra" loading="lazy" width="750" height="563" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20190608_165627-14.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190608_165627-14.jpg 750w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="2-the-numerous-museums-and-galleries">2. The numerous museums and galleries</h2><p>Canberra is not short on museums or galleries and again, there is bound to be one that appeals to all tastes from the National Museum of Australia to the interactive science museum, Questacon. A personal&#xA0;favourite&#xA0;is the <a href="https://nga.gov.au/?ref=localhost">National Gallery of Australia</a>.</p><p>The gallery has plenty to see with free admission, although the constantly changing special exhibitions do require a ticket. It&apos;s very easy to spend the best part of a day in the gallery.&#xA0;</p><p>Also worth a mention is some of the art work and sculptures you&#x2019;ll see around Canberra. The guys below (John Curtin &amp; Ben Chiefly) are also a favourite.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190609_120620-01-18.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Ten things to do in Canberra" loading="lazy" width="500" height="616"></figure><h2 id="3-old-parliament-house">3. Old Parliament House&#xA0;</h2><p>This is perhaps my personal&#xA0;favourite&#xA0;stop in Canberra (Lauren). Even if you don&apos;t love reading up on past Prime Ministers of Australia like I do, the building itself holds lots of history &#x2013; even standing on the stairs alone brings back images of Gough Whitlam&#x2019;s famous speech post &apos;the dismissal&apos;. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190609_123010-21-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Ten things to do in Canberra" loading="lazy" width="750" height="563" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20190609_123010-21-1.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190609_123010-21-1.jpg 750w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Entry to <a href="https://www.moadoph.gov.au/?ref=localhost">Old Parliament House</a> is cheap and they also do free tours that take you through the old chambers and offices that previous prime ministers and ministers once inhabited, with special exhibits and displays from time to time. The surrounding gardens are also worth checking out!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20180609_121123-1.jpg" width="500" height="667" loading="lazy" alt="Ten things to do in Canberra"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20180609_121629-2.jpg" width="500" height="667" loading="lazy" alt="Ten things to do in Canberra"></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="4-new-parliament-house">4. New Parliament House</h2><p>An interestingly designed building where history is being created. Again, you can do a free tour or just go for a wonder around. Come to <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Visit_Parliament?ref=localhost">New Parliament House</a> to see the paintings of prime ministers past and present, the chambers and the view from the top which looks straight across Canberra to the War Memorial at the other end.&#xA0;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190609_125345-24.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Ten things to do in Canberra" loading="lazy" width="500" height="667"></figure><p>There&#x2019;s also exhibits and events and if you&#x2019;re lucky, you can watch question time and see bills being debated in the house.</p><h2 id="5-namadgi-national-park">5. NAMADGI NATIONAL PARK</h2><p>About a 45 minute drive from the centre of Canberra, this national park has lots to offer with its many bushwalks and views. Go for a picnic, visit the &#x2018;Homestead Triangle&#x2019;, see the rock art at Yankee Hat and say hi to the many, many kangaroos.  If you&#x2019;re planning to camp stop by the <a href="https://www.environment.act.gov.au/parks-conservation/parks-and-reserves/find-a-park/namadgi-national-park/namadgi-national-park?ref=localhost">Namadgi Visitor Centre</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/_MG_5503-4.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Ten things to do in Canberra" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/_MG_5503-4.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/_MG_5503-4.jpg 750w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="6-walking-trails">6. Walking trails&#xA0;</h2><p>There are many of these and to be honest we&#x2019;ve only done a couple. Perhaps one of the most well know is the Mount Ainslie summit trail, behind the Australian War Memorial. It&apos;s not a long walk, about 4km return but is steep in parts and finishes with an amazing view of the city, looking back at New Parliament House&#xA0;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20180610_124618-01-5.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Ten things to do in Canberra" loading="lazy" width="750" height="750" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20180610_124618-01-5.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20180610_124618-01-5.jpg 750w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="7-australian-war-memorial">7. Australian War Memorial</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20180610_115738-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Ten things to do in Canberra" loading="lazy" width="500" height="500"></figure><p>Another place where you can spend the best part of a day, I haven&apos;t included this under Museums because it is in a category of its own. To be transparent, we haven&apos;t had a real good session here, we did skip through it quicker than most. However anyone looking to get a better understanding and appreciation of Australia&apos;s war history should check the <a href="https://www.awm.gov.au/?ref=localhost">War Memorial</a> out. It is an amazing monument and museum.&#xA0;</p><h2 id="8-wineries">8. Wineries</h2><p>Canberra has a well established wine region that is only half an hour from the city. In all honesty, I feel like Canberra wines are a little bit underrated and punch above their weight. I also love that you can get to the wineries so easily and just go for a nice lunch. Some favourites we&#x2019;ve been to include <a href="https://clonakilla.com.au/?ref=localhost">Clonakilla</a> (famous for their Syrah), <a href="https://www.lakegeorgewinery.com.au/?ref=localhost">Lake George Winery</a>, <a href="https://www.leridaestate.com.au/?ref=localhost">Lerida Estate Wines</a> and <a href="https://www.poacherspantry.com.au/?ref=localhost">Poachers Pantry</a> for lunch.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20180611_132026-9.jpg" width="750" height="563" loading="lazy" alt="Ten things to do in Canberra" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20180611_132026-9.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20180611_132026-9.jpg 750w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20180611_145612-11.jpg" width="750" height="563" loading="lazy" alt="Ten things to do in Canberra" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20180611_145612-11.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20180611_145612-11.jpg 750w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="9-breweries">9. Breweries</h2><p>If wine isn&#x2019;t your thing, or you just feel like a cold ale, then Canberra has that for you as well. There&#x2019;s a few breweries in Canberra, but the two we&#x2019;re most familiar with are <a href="https://www.capitalbrewing.co/?ref=localhost">Capital Brewing Co</a> and&#xA0;<a href="https://www.bentspokebrewing.com.au/splash/?ref=localhost">BentSpoke Brewing Co</a>. Both have excellent beers, although BentSpoke perhaps has my favourite beer. However Capital Brewing has a great location and set up, not to mention a Brodburger truck on site, health food to go with your cold beer :-).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190609_153528-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Ten things to do in Canberra" loading="lazy" width="500" height="667"></figure><h2 id="10-food-and-coffee-experiences">10. Food and coffee experiences</h2><p>Canberra is not short on awesome places to eat and caffeine up. From more casual eateries to fine dining, it has you covered.&#xA0;</p><p>On the coffee front check out <a href="https://onacoffee.com.au/?ref=localhost">ONA coffee</a>, which thankfully now has a site in Sydney. ONA serves AMAZING coffee and the staff&#xA0;really know their stuff when if comes to selecting the perfect bean.&#xA0;You can go to their Fyshwick ONA Coffee House, although I really love <a href="https://www.thecuppingroom.com.au/?ref=localhost">The Cupping Room</a>. Honorable mentions as well to <a href="http://www.barriocollective.com/?ref=localhost">Barrio Collective Coffee</a> and Coffee Lab.</p><p>On the food front you can not go past <a href="https://mocanandgreengrout.net/?ref=localhost">Mocan and Green Grout</a> for simple food made with fresh produce. For fine dining <a href="https://www.aubergine.com.au/?ref=localhost">Aubergine</a>&#xA0;is the go. Arriving at the restaurant it is all very understated, but inside is an elegant establishment and foodies delight.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20180609_154352-3.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Ten things to do in Canberra" loading="lazy" width="750" height="563" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20180609_154352-3.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20180609_154352-3.jpg 750w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="thats-a-wrap">That&apos;s a wrap!</h2><p>And so you have it, our top ten things to do in Canberra.

Canberra is great for Sydney siders looking to escape the hustle and bustle of the city but not lose all of the amenities that come with a big city like great food and coffee, bars, shops, etc. And I can never get over the fact that you can drive from one end of the city to the other in around 15 minutes and reach beautiful wineries or national park in just over half an hour.</p><p>This trip was a getaway for the Queen&#x2019;s birthday long weekend and despite the frosty mornings we were able to get out and explore new wineries, the Namadgi National Park and take a stroll around central Canberra. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20180610_133547-7.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Canberra long weekend" loading="lazy" width="750" height="563" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20180610_133547-7.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20180610_133547-7.jpg 750w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="where-we-stayed">Where we stayed</h2><p>We stayed at <a href="https://littlenationalhotel.com.au/?ref=localhost">Little National Hotel</a>, located in Barton in the Realm Precinct. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190608_161306-10.jpg" width="500" height="667" loading="lazy" alt="Canberra long weekend"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190608_161338-1.jpg" width="500" height="500" loading="lazy" alt="Canberra long weekend"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190608_163651-11.jpg" width="500" height="667" loading="lazy" alt="Canberra long weekend"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190609_142042-28.jpg" width="500" height="667" loading="lazy" alt="Canberra long weekend"></div></div></div></figure><p>This is our third stay there and won&#x2019;t be our last.

Stellenbosch has so many places to choose from. Unfortunately some of the more popular ones (e.g. The Fat Butcher) get so busy that you need to reserve a table a few days out (at least), so a bit of advice there for others to book in advance if you are keen on a particular restaurant. We were not so organised and had to wing it a little.</p><p>The next day we had planned to self drive to some of the wineries in the region, however had then heard about a hop on - hop off tram in nearby Franschhoek that takes you to a number of wineries. We thought this might be more fun so booked tickets for <a href="https://winetram.co.za/?ref=localhost">the tram</a> and headed off (you can get an Uber between the towns so its not too expensive).</p><p>Franschhoek feels a bit like Stellenbosch with similar architecture and the mountains just behind the town.

We were also lucky to finally get some sunny weather so could sit outside and enjoy our wine tasting.</p><p>We ended up visiting only 4 wineries, spending a bit of extra time in the final winery after meeting people and having a nice chat. </p><p>The wineries we visited were: Grand Provence, Rickety Bridge, La Bri and Holden Manz.  And I&#x2019;m going to say something a little controversial, that being that I actually don&#x2019;t rate their star grape in the region, Pinotage.

Lots of nice restaurants and cafes, streets lined with colourful buildings. Which brings me to Bo Kaap.</p><p>The Bo-Kaap area was only a few blocks from where we stayed and very cool to walk around. The area was formerly known as the Malay Quarter and is a former township. Today it appeared to have a mix of ethnicities living there and lots of families.

One of our reasons for this trip, and more specifically Durban, was to visit friends that we had made from our time in Zambia. We hadn&#x2019;t seen each other in 7 years so a catch up was long overdue.</p><p>I wanted to start by explaining this, as going back through our photos from our week in Durban, there wasn&#x2019;t as many as I thought. I guess we were having too much fun with our friends. Anyways&#x2026;..here are some of the highlights from Durban, as well as Sani Pass, which I&#x2019;ve separated out a little because it was an epic day of travel and pretty amazing.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190409_102244-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Durban (Including Sani Pass visit)" loading="lazy" width="800" height="600" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20190409_102244-1.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190409_102244-1.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="durban">DURBAN</h2><p>First, to where we stayed in Durban. As we were catching up with friends, we wanted to stay close to them. So we found a guesthouse, Mythai Guesthouse, in the suburb of Morningside. It was comfortable, a large room and ensuite, surrounded by beautiful tropical gardens and backed on to the Florida Road strip of shops, cafes and bars. It was also pretty cheap. I think we paid something like 500AUD for the 5 nights we stayed. Would I have stayed there if we didn&#x2019;t know anyone? Probably not. I think the Umhlanga area is much more an area for visitors, but for what we wanted, it was perfect.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190410_161156-9.jpg" width="800" height="600" loading="lazy" alt="Durban (Including Sani Pass visit)" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20190410_161156-9.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190410_161156-9.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190410_161252-10.jpg" width="800" height="600" loading="lazy" alt="Durban (Including Sani Pass visit)" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20190410_161252-10.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190410_161252-10.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190411_154858-16.jpg" width="600" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Durban (Including Sani Pass visit)" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190411_154858-16.jpg 600w"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190411_165925-17.jpg" width="600" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Durban (Including Sani Pass visit)" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190411_165925-17.jpg 600w"></div></div></div></figure><p>One of the first things our friends took us to was the Durban city coast. We hired bikes for a couple of hours and rode the 5km path along the beach and city area and back. This was a great way to get a feel for the city. It was clear that at a point in time this part of Durban must have been amazing. It still is very nice albeit a bit run down in some areas. But I&#x2019;d definitely recommend hiring bikes and doing this ride.</p><p>On a seperate evening our friends took us to the Umhlanga area for a night out. This is a pretty happening place with bars, restaurants, hotels, shops, etc. One of the highlights though was The Oyster Box. This is a an upmarket hotel with gorgeous restaurants and bar. We didn&#x2019;t eat there, but from all accounts the breakfast and high tea are meant to be amazing; we did however a few cocktails as we watched the sun go down (or if there had been sun). They were awesome cocktails, so good that I failed to even get a photo, remembering on our final drink when the light was gone :-(. Seriously, if in Durban you need to visit The Oyster Box.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190411_173855-19.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Durban (Including Sani Pass visit)" loading="lazy" width="800" height="600" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20190411_173855-19.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190411_173855-19.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190411_172634-18.jpg" width="800" height="600" loading="lazy" alt="Durban (Including Sani Pass visit)" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20190411_172634-18.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190411_172634-18.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190411_191607-21.jpg" width="800" height="600" loading="lazy" alt="Durban (Including Sani Pass visit)" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20190411_191607-21.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190411_191607-21.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><p>The Florida Road area where we stayed was also a nice place to hang out, although again, I failed to take many photos.

Clearly it does not picture well (below) but I kind of need to include the photo because when I describe it to people, they don&#x2019;t really get it. Basically Bunny Chow is a South African fast food dish consisting of a hollowed-out loaf of white bread filled with curry (Durban Curry). It originated among Indian South Africans of Durban and has a bit of a zing. Messy but good.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190410_130207-3.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Durban (Including Sani Pass visit)" loading="lazy" width="800" height="600" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20190410_130207-3.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190410_130207-3.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>One of the other highlights was a visit out to the Natal Midlands. This area is frequented by domestic tourists and I can see why! The landscape was green and mountainous, there were lots of places to stop for arts and craft, food and drink, wineries, etc. We stopped for lunch at a place called Piggly Wiggly Country Village, which you can easily hang out at for 2-3 hours.</p><p>The Natal Midlands is also the area where Nelson Mandela was captured all those years ago, prior to being sent away to Robbin Island for 27 years.</p><p>The Nelson Mandela Capture Site was really well put together with a small visitor centre/ museum on his life and the below pictured sculpture. What was amazing about the sculpture is that close up, and just walking around it, it&#x2019;s just a whole lot of black posts. But standing back in the right position it makes out his face, which comes up even better on a camera than when I was looking at it.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190411_103114-01-12.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Durban (Including Sani Pass visit)" loading="lazy" width="800" height="800" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20190411_103114-01-12.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190411_103114-01-12.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190411_103230-13.jpg" width="600" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Durban (Including Sani Pass visit)" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190411_103230-13.jpg 600w"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190411_103737-14.jpg" width="800" height="600" loading="lazy" alt="Durban (Including Sani Pass visit)" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20190411_103737-14.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190411_103737-14.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><p>One more highlight in Durban was the Durban Botanic Gardens which had lots of unqiue trees and flowers, and was just generally a nice place to be.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190410_140136-4.jpg" width="800" height="600" loading="lazy" alt="Durban (Including Sani Pass visit)" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20190410_140136-4.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190410_140136-4.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190410_143520-5.jpg" width="600" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Durban (Including Sani Pass visit)" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190410_143520-5.jpg 600w"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190410_144003-6.jpg" width="600" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Durban (Including Sani Pass visit)" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190410_144003-6.jpg 600w"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190410_144316-7.jpg" width="800" height="600" loading="lazy" alt="Durban (Including Sani Pass visit)" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20190410_144316-7.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190410_144316-7.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="sani-pass">SANI PASS</h2><p>Sani Pass is a mountain pass located in the west of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa on the road between Underberg, KwaZulu-Natal and Mokhotlong, Lesotho. </p><p>The route up Sani Pass starts at 1544 m, and climbs 1332 vertical metres to an altitude of 2876 m.

And for some reason, I&#x2019;d agreed to camp in Fran&#x2019;s roof tent.</p><p>Anyway, we didn&#x2019;t let the cold stop us from walks into town and a short hike in the mountains.</p><p>We&#x2019;ve done a few trips to the Blue Mountains now and always try and check out something new, as well as visit old favourites. </p><p>We didn&#x2019;t feel like hiking when we arrived so instead opted for old favourites, exploring the town of Katoomba, eventually ending up at The Carrington Hotel.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190331_163208-22.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The Blue Mountains" loading="lazy" width="800" height="600" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20190331_163208-22.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190331_163208-22.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I love walking up the main street of Katoomba and checking out the mix of outdoor and antique/ trinket stores. There&#x2019;s definitely a varied retail offering.</p><p>The Carrington Hotel had the fireplace going in the lounge area which was perfect for enjoying a quiet drink away from the cold outside (I also love their little store at the back of the hotel which sells a great selection of cheese and wine, two of my favourite things).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190330_175955-1.jpg" width="600" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="The Blue Mountains" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190330_175955-1.jpg 600w"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190331_163239-23.jpg" width="600" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="The Blue Mountains" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190331_163239-23.jpg 600w"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190331_163610-24.jpg" width="600" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="The Blue Mountains" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190331_163610-24.jpg 600w"></div></div></div></figure><p>For dinner that evening we tried a restaurant we&#x2019;d never been to before which apparently used to split its menu between American focused food (think burgers and mac n cheese) and a bistro menu, upstairs versus downstairs. Palette Dining recently did a bit of a remake of their menu and offering and now offer both menus regardless of where you&#x2019;re seated. We went for the bistro food choices, but the burgers looked pretty good.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190330_190330-2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The Blue Mountains" loading="lazy" width="800" height="600" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_20190330_190330-2.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2025/06/IMG_20190330_190330-2.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The following day was a struggle to get going; the roof tent was surprisingly warm, it was just outside that was the problem.
