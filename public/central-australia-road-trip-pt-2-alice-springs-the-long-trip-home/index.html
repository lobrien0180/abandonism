            <p>As alluded to in <a href="https://www.abandonism.com/blog/central-australia-pt1?ref=localhost">part one of our Central Australia trip post</a>, the second half of our drive underwent a major change. Our original itinerary had us heading to Alice Springs and then further north before turning back east on a scenic journey back to Sydney. However a combination of extreme heat, advice from locals in regards to the state of the Plenty Highway and the lack of vehicle preparedness (e.g. only a single spare tyre) added up to the very difficult decision to turn Fran around at Alice Springs and head back South. We’ve included a bit more detail on this <a href="https://www.abandonism.com/blog/central-australia-pt2?ref=localhost#itinerary">below in our itinerary section</a>. But for now, we had a trip to continue on, next stop Alice Springs.</p><h2 id="alice-springs-to-sydney">Alice Springs to Sydney</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-24-at-12.54.34-pm.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1212" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-24-at-12.54.34-pm.png 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-24-at-12.54.34-pm.png 1000w, ../content/images/size/w1600/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-24-at-12.54.34-pm.png 1600w, ../content/images/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-24-at-12.54.34-pm.png 2346w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="alice-springs">Alice Springs </h3><p>The drive from Uluru to Alice Springs was a pleasant one. For once we had what was a relatively short distance to drive (only 450km and 5 hours compared to the 10+ hour drives we had been doing) on a good road with nice scenery.</p><p>For example, check out this guy below. He is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorny_devil?ref=localhost">Thorny Devil</a> and looks much scarier than he actually is. He sat on the side of the Lasseter Highway and we were so excited we turned Fran around to go back and see him. He sat really still so we could photograph him too 😄</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2025/06/IMG_2024.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_2024.jpg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_2024.jpg 1000w, ../content/images/2025/06/IMG_2024.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The next fun stop was to see Mount Conner. We had actually seen this mountain on the way to Uluru and for a brief moment were tricked into thinking it was Uluru. I guess that’s why they call it ‘Fool-uru’.</p><p>Shortly after that we came across a caravan of camels, right in the middle of the road. I was a bit slow with the camera this time, but we did manage to catch them as they moved into the bushes.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2025/06/IMG_2033.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_2033.jpg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_2033.jpg 1000w, ../content/images/2025/06/IMG_2033.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/06/IMG_2029.jpg" width="1500" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_2029.jpg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_2029.jpg 1000w, ../content/images/2025/06/IMG_2029.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/06/IMG_2026.jpg" width="1500" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/06/IMG_2026.jpg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/IMG_2026.jpg 1000w, ../content/images/2025/06/IMG_2026.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><p>In Alice Springs we went directly to our accommodation, the <a href="https://www.ihg.com/crowneplaza/hotels/gb/en/alice-springs/aspas/hoteldetail?ref=localhost">Crowne Plaza Alice Springs Lasseters</a>. </p><p>When we booked this hotel back in Sydney we didn’t pick up on the fact that it was linked to a casino and normally would not have been thrilled about that, but the hotel felt quite separate from the casino. We were also there for NYE which actually worked out well as that was where most of the party action was happening.</p><p>Oh, the other really great thing about this hotel was the laundry room which has DIY coin-operated machines and was super economical. The timing was perfect as we had saved up a bit of washing by this point.</p><p>Alice Springs itself was a pretty chilled town. It had all the amenities you would expect for a town that size in addition to a ton of art galleries displaying local artist’s work. Disappointingly, because we were there during the holiday season, a lot of them were closed.

While the extreme heat was a factor, we would have managed that. it was really the advice from locals in regards to the state of the Plenty Highway that changed our minds. We had done research prior to our trip and learned that the road conditions do vary throughout the year,<strong> </strong>but nothing indicated to us just how bad it actually would be.<strong> </strong></p><p>We had planned on averaging somewhere between 60-80km/h on a corrugated but consistent surface meaning the 750km road could be done in a long day, but recent reports from locals indicated long sections with speeds down to 30km/h. Combined with a lack of vehicle preparedness (e.g. only a single spare tyre) and lack of experience with Fran’s fuel consumption, we made the difficult decision to turn around at Alice Springs and head back South.<strong> </strong>Refer to the <a href="https://www.boulia.qld.gov.au/?ref=localhost">Boulia Shire Council</a> website for latest conditions if you are planning on travelling along the Plenty Highway.</p><p>We are still keen to get to places like Birdsville and Mudgee so we’ll have to plan those into future trips (and Mike still has an appointment with Big Red). </p><p>If we were to re-do this trip we would re-jig our Uluru and Alice Springs time, removing a night from each, so that we could add Kings Canyon. Missing the Canyon was a bit of a disappointment but I guess that’s just another reason to visit there again in the future.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2025/06/Itinerary.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="747" height="240" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/06/Itinerary.jpeg 600w, ../content/images/2025/06/Itinerary.jpeg 747w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>
