            <p>I know I refer to a lot of places we visit as being ‘on the list’. But if we were to talk true bucket list destinations then Egypt has to have been at the top of that list.</p><p>About 3-4 years ago we looked at Egypt and seriously considered going, however there was still political instability in the country and the odd terrorist attack and so we shelved it for a while longer. But mid-last year when we were planning future coming trips, Egypt finally felt like a ‘go’ and so we booked it in.</p><p>Then to the itinerary. Because there are so many historic sites in Egypt and they are quite spread out we struggled to come up with a plan and certainly one that was easy to execute. We are not tour group people and we spent months fighting what appeared to be the easiest way to do it. We tried re-creating tour itineraries and honestly, I think it can be done if you have a bit of time to spend on the planning and booking processes, but time is something we’re generally quite poor in and so after months of indecision we capitulated and booked ourselves on a tour.</p><p>The company we chose was <a href="https://www.gadventures.com.au/?ref=localhost">G Adventures</a> as they have a number of tours in Egypt. We were looking for something that was just short of 2 weeks and covered as much ground as possible, leading us to choose the<a href="https://www.gadventures.com.au/trips/egypt-upgraded/7386/?ref=localhost"> Egypt Upgraded</a> tour. The tour went for 12 days, although the first and last days were really nothing days that you could use how you chose. We also added a day to see some more of Cairo, not something we’d generally recommend, but more about that <a href="https://www.abandonism.com/blog/egypt?ref=localhost#itinerary">below</a>. The other thing we liked about G Adventures was that the guide is a qualified Egyptologist, something that is difficult to access when organising the trip on your own. </p><p>For this post I haven’t broken it down on a day by basis but rather location. However if you are interested in the itinerary we followed, or the hotels we stayed in, please refer to the <a href="https://www.gadventures.com.au/trips/egypt-upgraded/7386/itinerary/?ref=localhost">Egypt Upgraded itinerary</a> for further details. </p><p>We’ve also provided some final <a href="https://www.abandonism.com/blog/egypt?ref=localhost#itinerary">thoughts and potential tweaks</a> you could make towards the end of this post should you want to use the itinerary as a base for your own trip. But for now, let us show you Egypt!</p><h2 id="cairo">CAIRO</h2><p>Our time and tour in Egypt started and ended in Cairo and we had added a day at both ends. </p><p>Cairo is massive and has a population of around 20 million people when you include the ‘greater Cairo’ area. Like any city of this size it suffers from traffic gridlock and high levels of pollution. Also evident when getting around Cairo are the low income levels. But the people are generally nice and very willing to help tourists.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2025/05/IMG_2818.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_2818.jpg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/IMG_2818.jpg 1000w, ../content/images/2025/05/IMG_2818.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>As we knew that the Pyramids and Museum would be covered on our tour we decided to check out other parts of the city. Our hotel (the one designated by G Adventures) was located in Giza. It turns out the hotel was great for seeing the pyramids but not seeing anything else as it is quite a way out of the city.</p><p>We spent a good part of one of our free days checking our Khan el Kalili and surrounds. Khan el-Khalili is an ancient bazaar adjacent to the Al-Hussein Mosque. </p><p>In the bazaar we wondered around checking out the many treasures for sale and drinking Egyptian coffee. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2025/05/IMG_2773-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_2773-1.jpg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/IMG_2773-1.jpg 1000w, ../content/images/2025/05/IMG_2773-1.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/05/IMG_20200218_125559-02.jpg" width="1500" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_20200218_125559-02.jpg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/IMG_20200218_125559-02.jpg 1000w, ../content/images/2025/05/IMG_20200218_125559-02.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/05/IMG_2793.jpg" width="999" height="999" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_2793.jpg 600w, ../content/images/2025/05/IMG_2793.jpg 999w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><p>On a different day we took an Uber to the Egyptian Museum and went for a walk around the local neighbourhood. We then walked across to Gezira Island via the Qasr al-Nil Bridge. As a side note we had planned to look around Tahrir Square, the centre of the Arab Spring protests, but were advised to come on a different day by a local man. We were there on a Friday (day of prayer) and he told us that Friday’s can get a bit ‘political’ and didn’t want us to get caught up in anything. He said it was ‘safe’ just better to come back on a different day.</p><p>Gezira Island felt like a more ‘upmarket’ area with its sporting clubs and embassies. We did a lot of walking on the island, walking from one end to the other, via the Cairo Tower (we didn’t go up the tower). At the other end and after many hours of walking we had a late lunch at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/leftbankonline">Left Bank</a>, a cozy cafe with delicious food and a beautiful view of the water.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/05/IMG_2182.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_2182.jpg 600w, ../content/images/2025/05/IMG_2182.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/05/IMG_20200207_150008.jpg" width="1125" height="1125" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_20200207_150008.jpg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/IMG_20200207_150008.jpg 1000w, ../content/images/2025/05/IMG_20200207_150008.jpg 1125w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/05/IMG_20200207_145817.jpg" width="1125" height="1125" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_20200207_145817.jpg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/IMG_20200207_145817.jpg 1000w, ../content/images/2025/05/IMG_20200207_145817.jpg 1125w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><p>The rest of Cairo we saw on our tour.</p><p>Our tour started with the Pyramids of Giza. Given the close proximity to our hotel, we arrived there early and listened to the history of the pyramids from our guide and Egyptologist Sa’id before having time to go for a wonder and take a ton of photos.  </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2025/05/_MG_5799.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/05/_MG_5799.jpg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/_MG_5799.jpg 1000w, ../content/images/2025/05/_MG_5799.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The pyramids are amazing and I had to keep pinching myself to believe we were actually there. That said, they were actually not the most amazing site we visited in Egypt and we were a little disappointed to see how close the city gets to the site with new buildings and housing estates starting to encroach on the sandy area.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2025/05/IMG_2214.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_2214.jpg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/IMG_2214.jpg 1000w, ../content/images/2025/05/IMG_2214.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>We also paid for entrance to the Great Pyramid to see what was inside (you could also pay for entrance to the second pyramid). Inside the Great Pyramid it was very crowded and if you are claustrophobic I’d strongly advise against going in there as the descending passage is extremely narrow and dark. We did make it to the centre but truthfully I was really glad to get back out. Others in our tour did the second pyramid and if we were to do this again we would definitely go for the smaller pyramid where entrance was cheaper and there were less people. </p><p>Following our inspection of the pyramids we wondered down to see the Sphinx. Again the experience felt a little surreal after seeing this structure so many times in photos and documentaries but it is smaller than I’d expected.</p><p>One tip and it is a kind of an obvious one - get to the Pyramids and Sphinx as early as you can. We actually made a return visit on our final day in Cairo as we wanted to try and get photos without all of the people, and we were mostly successful as most tourists and groups start at the Great Pyramid and spend quite a bit of time there before moving to the other monuments. We definitely felt it was worth the return visit.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/05/_MG_5740.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/05/_MG_5740.jpg 600w, ../content/images/2025/05/_MG_5740.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/05/IMG_2823.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_2823.jpg 600w, ../content/images/2025/05/IMG_2823.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><p> The <a href="https://egyptianmuseum.org/?ref=localhost">Egyptian Museum</a> in central Cairo was amazing for the amount of pieces it holds and based on what our guide Sa’id explained, the public only ever see a fraction of everything that gets stored there. That said, while we were there a lot of work was under way to move major pieces to the new <a href="http://gem.gov.eg/?ref=localhost">Grand Egyptian Museum</a> located in Giza. This new museum was still under construction when we were there, but judging by its size, it looked like it would be easy to spend a whole day there.</p><p>For the existing museum, I would note that without our guide this museum would be very difficult to make sense of. There are so many pieces on display, most without any explanation. We spent a couple of hours with our group and Sa’id before having another couple of hours on our own to explore, including a visit to the Mummy Rooms where for a small additional cost you can view the ancient remains of some of Egypt’s most important rulers. Truthfully I found those rooms a little creepy but glad we checked them out all the same. </p><p>The (existing) museum should take a half day visit but do try and get a guide to take you through it before exploring yourself in order to get maximum value and appreciation of what you will see.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/05/IMG_20200210_142811.jpg" width="1125" height="1125" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_20200210_142811.jpg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/IMG_20200210_142811.jpg 1000w, ../content/images/2025/05/IMG_20200210_142811.jpg 1125w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/05/IMG_20200210_141818.jpg" width="1125" height="1125" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_20200210_141818.jpg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/IMG_20200210_141818.jpg 1000w, ../content/images/2025/05/IMG_20200210_141818.jpg 1125w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/05/download_20200603_104020.jpg" width="656" height="656" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/05/download_20200603_104020.jpg 600w, ../content/images/2025/05/download_20200603_104020.jpg 656w"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/05/download_20200603_104017.jpg" width="1125" height="1125" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/05/download_20200603_104017.jpg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/download_20200603_104017.jpg 1000w, ../content/images/2025/05/download_20200603_104017.jpg 1125w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="alexandria">ALEXANDRIA</h2><p>Not actually in Alexandria, but on our way from Cairo to Alexandria, we stopped by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastery_of_Saint_Pishoy?ref=localhost">St Bishoy Monastery</a> in Wadi El-Natrun. </p><p>This monastery is the most eastern surviving Christian monastery in the Wadi el-Natrun and the most famous of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria and was found by St. Bishoy (hence the name).</p><p>The monastery is amazing and dates back to the 4th century.

The catacombs seemed to merge Roman, Greek and Egyptian styles and apparently after not being used since the 4th century were rediscovered in in 1900 when a donkey accidentally fell into the access shaft. </p><p>Our visit to the catacombs was followed by a visit to the close by Pompey's Pillar, a Roman triumphal column and one of the best-known ancient monuments still standing in Alexandria today. We learned that the name "Pompey's Pillar" is actually a misnomer, as it has nothing to do with Pompey, having been erected in 293AD for Emperor Diocletian.</p><p>Next we took a look at the new Library of Alexandria, The Bibliotheca Alexandrina. The library was inaugurated in 2002 near the site of the old Royal Library of Alexandria, what had once been the largest library in the world. That said, the new library was pretty impressive in its own right.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/05/IMG_20200209_085402.jpg" width="1125" height="1125" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_20200209_085402.jpg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/IMG_20200209_085402.jpg 1000w, ../content/images/2025/05/IMG_20200209_085402.jpg 1125w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/05/IMG_2275.jpg" width="999" height="999" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_2275.jpg 600w, ../content/images/2025/05/IMG_2275.jpg 999w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/05/IMG_2312.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_2312.jpg 600w, ../content/images/2025/05/IMG_2312.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/05/IMG_2296.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_2296.jpg 600w, ../content/images/2025/05/IMG_2296.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/05/IMG_2295.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_2295.jpg 600w, ../content/images/2025/05/IMG_2295.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2025/05/IMG_2287.jpg" width="999" height="999" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_2287.jpg 600w, ../content/images/2025/05/IMG_2287.jpg 999w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><p>We also made a visit to the Citadel of Qaitbay, a 15th-century defensive fortress located on the sea coast.

We then spent about 30 mins or so listening to our guide who gave us the history, a huge positive about being on a tour. Then the negative to being on a tour, we wanted to take photos at the same time as everyone else and it was chaos in and outside the temples as we got in peoples photos and they got in ours. So here is a hint: have a look around the temples and take them both in and then sit outside in the sunshine and just wait. At about 10:30am everyone starts to slowly leave and you can get good photos minus the crowds. Our tour guide had agreed to hold back an extra 15 mins so we could do that and it’s definitely the only way we could get the photos we did with the itinerary we were on. And as an added bonus we had time in between to really enjoy the temples. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2025/05/_MG_5775.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2025/05/_MG_5775.jpg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/_MG_5775.jpg 1000w, ../content/images/2025/05/_MG_5775.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="nile-cruise">NILE CRUISE</h2><p>Back in Aswan we boarded our accommodation for the next few nights, a river boat on the Nile. </p><p>There were at least a dozen boats lined up ready to take tourists.

While you definitely need to spend some time in Cairo, if for no other reason than to see the Giza Pyramids, it is just a big, chaotic city. It is difficult to get around, crowded and quite dirty. We were pretty annoyed we had actually added a day!</p><p>Also, our tour accommodation put us in Giza which wasn’t great for getting around, so maybe look more central if staying there longer than just to see the pyramids. A further tip: use Uber to get around. It’s extremely reliable, we felt safe (well as safe as you can in Cairo traffic) and there was no messing around with money, prices and haggling.</p><p>The next thought we had is in regards to visiting the city of Alexandria. </p><p>We liked Alexandria and there are some great things to see however we would recommend against going in the cooler months as it’s actually quite hostile to walking around. As a coastal city it would definitely be much nicer in the warmer months. Uber also worked well in Alexandria.</p><p>Down south is where most of the cool stuff to see is.</p><p>To get to southern Egypt we went by plane, as opposed to bus or train, flying Nile Air one way and EgyptAir the other. Both airlines were good when we flew them, on time and fairly efficient. I know bus or train would be cheaper, but if you are strapped for time and also as a DIY option where you can book online, flying works well.</p><p>What I would do differently from our tour itinerary, is fly to Abu Simbel as opposed to Aswan, stay for a night in Abu Simbel so that you can see the temples early before the crowds, and then arrange a transfer to Aswan. I don’t know about organising buses in one single direction although, in my experience, Egyptians always find a way to make things happen for a fee. Your other option is to fly from Abu Simbel to Aswan, a short (and from my understanding), fairly inexpensive flight. That way you can enjoy the town of Aswan for a night or two and continue to use it as the starting point for the Nile River Cruise. &nbsp;</p><p>Luxor was a great place to see a lot. We had two full days there which was probably spot on.</p><p>One thing we didn’t do and regretted later was to visit Saqqara and Memphis. Saqqara is the site of Egypt's first pyramid and we had the option of doing it on the final day of our tour but opted against it in order to get some rest (I wasn’t feeling well at this stage). However others in our group did do the day visit and it looked pretty awesome, so something worth looking into as a day trip.</p><p>If we had extra days another thing that would be great to build into an itinerary would be the southern coast of Egypt, known for snorkeling and diving opportunities, e.g. Wadi EL Gemal National Park, Hurghada, etc.</p><p>There are also places such as Sharm el-Sheikh, although Australian Government directives on where is safe to travel impact such itinerary decisions.</p><p><strong>Final word</strong></p><p>Obviously when you chose a group tour provider you are tied to a very specific itinerary and there’s always going to be some hits and misses.
